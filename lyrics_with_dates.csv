Luis Fonsi & Daddy Yankee,Despacito (Remix),"[Letra de ""Despacito (Remix)"" ft. Justin Bieber]

[Intro: Justin Bieber]
Comin' over in my direction
So thankful for that, it's such a blessin', yeah
Turn every situation into heaven, yeah
Oh-oh, you are
My sunrise on the darkest day
Got me feelin' some kind of way
Make me wanna savor every moment slowly, slowly
You fit me tailor-made, love how you put it on
Got the only key, know how to turn it on
The way you nibble on my ear, the only words I wanna hear
Baby, take it slow so we can last long

[Verso 1: Luis Fonsi & Daddy Yankee]
¡Oh! Tú, tú eres el imán y yo soy el metal
Me voy acercando y voy armando el plan
Sólo con pensarlo se acelera el pulso (Oh, yeah)
Ya, ya me está gustando más de lo normal
Todos mis sentidos van pidiendo más
Esto hay que tomarlo sin ningún apuro

[Coro: Justin Bieber & Luis Fonsi / Daddy Yankee]
Despacito
Quiero respirar tu cuello despacito
Deja que te diga cosas al oído
Para que te acuerdes si no estás conmigo
Despacito
Quiero desnudarte a besos despacito
Firmo en las paredes de tu laberinto
Y hacer de tu cuerpo todo un manuscrito
(Sube, sube, sube
Sube, sube)

[Post-Coro: Luis Fonsi & Daddy Yankee]
Quiero ver bailar tu pelo, quiero ser tu ritmo (Woah, woah)
Que le enseñes a mi boca (Woah, woah)
Tus lugares favoritos (Favorito, favorito, baby)
Déjame sobrepasar tus zonas de peligro (Woah, woah)
Hasta provocar tus gritos (Woah, woah)
Y que olvides tu apellido

[Verso 2: Daddy Yankee]
Si te pido un beso, ven, dámelo, yo sé que estás pensándolo
Llevo tiempo intentándolo, mami, esto es dando y dándolo
Sabes que tu corazón conmigo te hace bom, bom
Sabes que esa beba está buscando de mi bom, bom
Ven, prueba de mi boca para ver cómo te sabe
Quiero, quiero, quiero ver cuánto amor a ti te cabe
Yo no tengo prisa, yo me quiero dar el viaje
Empecemos lento, después salvaje

[Pre-Coro: Daddy Yankee & Justin Bieber / Daddy Yankee]
Pasito a pasito, suave suavecito
Nos vamos pegando, poquito a poquito
Cuando tú me besas con esa destreza
Veo que eres malicia con delicadeza
Pasito a pasito, suave suavecito
Nos vamos pegando, poquito a poquito
Y es que esa belleza es un rompecabezas
Pero pa' montarlo aquí tengo la pieza
¡Oye!

[Coro: Justin Bieber & Luis Fonsi / Daddy Yankee]
Despacito
Quiero respirar tu cuello despacito
Deja que te diga cosas al oído
Para que te acuerdes si no estás conmigo
Despacito
Quiero desnudarte a besos despacito
Firmo en las paredes de tu laberinto
Y hacer de tu cuerpo todo un manuscrito
(Sube, sube, sube
Sube, sube)

[Post-Coro: Luis Fonsi & Daddy Yankee]
Quiero ver bailar tu pelo, quiero ser tu ritmo (Woah, woah)
Que le enseñes a mi boca (Woah, woah)
Tus lugares favoritos (Favorito, favorito, baby)
Déjame sobrepasar tus zonas de peligro (Woah, woah)
Hasta provocar tus gritos (Woah, woah)
Y que olvides tu apellido

[Puente: Luis Fonsi]
Despacito
This is how we do it down in Puerto Rico
I just wanna hear you screaming, ""¡Ay, Bendito!""
I can move forever cuando esté contigo
¡Báilalo!

[Post-Coro: Daddy Yankee, Luis Fonsi & Justin Bieber]
Pasito a pasito, suave suavecito
Nos vamos pegando, poquito a poquito
Que le enseñes a mi boca
Tus lugares favoritos
(Favorito, favorito, baby)
Pasito a pasito, suave suavecito
Nos vamos pegando, poquito a poquito
Hasta provocar tus gritos (Fonsi)
Y que olvides tu apellido (D.Y.)
Despacito",Now That’s What I Call Music! 97 [UK],22.7M,"April 17, 2017"
Eminem,Rap God,"[Intro]
""Look, I was gonna go easy on you not to hurt your feelings.""
""But I'm only going to get this one chance.""
""Something's wrong, I can feel it.""
Six minutes. Six minutes. Six minutes, Slim Shady, you're on!
""Just a feeling I've got. Like something's about to happen, but I don't know what. If that means what I think it means, we're in trouble, big trouble; and if he is as bananas as you say, I'm not taking any chances.""
""You are just what the doc ordered.""

[Chorus]
I'm beginnin' to feel like a Rap God, Rap God
All my people from the front to the back nod, back nod
Now, who thinks their arms are long enough to slap box, slap box?
They said I rap like a robot, so call me Rap-bot

[Verse 1]
But for me to rap like a computer it must be in my genes
I got a laptop in my back pocket
My pen'll go off when I half-cock it
Got a fat knot from that rap profit
Made a livin' and a killin' off it
Ever since Bill Clinton was still in office
With Monica Lewinsky feelin' on his nutsack
I'm an MC still as honest
But as rude and as indecent as all hell
Syllables, skill-a-holic (Kill 'em all with)
This flippity dippity-hippity hip-hop
You don't really wanna get into a pissin' match
With this rappity brat, packin' a MAC in the back of the Ac'
Backpack rap crap, yap-yap, yackety-yack
And at the exact same time, I attempt these lyrical acrobat stunts while I'm practicin' that
I'll still be able to break a motherfuckin' table
Over the back of a couple of faggots and crack it in half
Only realized it was ironic, I was signed to Aftermath after the fact
How could I not blow? All I do is drop F-bombs
Feel my wrath of attack
Rappers are havin' a rough time period, here's a maxi pad
It's actually disastrously bad for the wack
While I'm masterfully constructing this masterpiece as

[Chorus]
'Cause I'm beginnin' to feel like a Rap God, Rap God
All my people from the front to the back nod, back nod
Now, who thinks their arms are long enough to slap box, slap box?
Let me show you maintainin' this shit ain't that hard, that hard

[Verse 2]
Everybody wants the key and the secret to rap immortality like Ι have got. Well, to be truthful the blueprint's
Simply rage and youthful exuberance
Everybody loves to root for a nuisance
Hit the Earth like an asteroid
Did nothing but shoot for the Moon since (Pew!)
MCs get taken to school with this music
'Cause I use it as a vehicle to ""bus the rhyme""
Now I lead a new school full of students
Me? I'm a product of Rakim
Lakim Shabazz, 2Pac, N.W.A, Cube, hey Doc, Ren
Yella, Eazy, thank you, they got Slim
Inspired enough to one day grow up, blow up and be in a position
To meet Run–D.M.C., induct them
Into the motherfuckin' Rock and Roll Hall of Fame
Even though I'll walk in the church and burst in a ball of flames
Only Hall of Fame I'll be inducted in is the alcohol of fame
On the wall of shame
You fags think it's all a game, 'til I walk a flock of flames
Off a plank and, tell me what in the fuck are you thinkin'?
Little gay-lookin' boy
So gay I can barely say it with a straight face, lookin' boy
You're witnessin' a massacre
Like you're watching a church gathering take place, lookin' boy
""Oy vey, that boy's gay!""—that's all they say, lookin' boy
You get a thumbs up, pat on the back
And a ""way to go"" from your label every day, lookin' boy
Hey, lookin' boy! What you say, lookin' boy?
I get a ""hell yeah"" from Dre, lookin' boy
I'ma work for everything I have, never ask nobody for shit
Get outta my face, lookin' boy!
Basically, boy, you're never gonna be capable
Of keepin' up with the same pace, lookin' boy, 'cause—

[Chorus]
I'm beginnin' to feel like a Rap God, Rap God
All my people from the front to the back nod, back nod
The way I'm racin' around the track, call me NASCAR, NASCAR
Dale Earnhardt of the trailer park, the White Trash God
Kneel before General Zod
This planet's Krypton—no, Asgard, Asgard

[Verse 3]
So you'll be Thor and I'll be Odin
You rodent, I'm omnipotent
Let off, then I'm reloadin'
Immediately with these bombs, I'm totin'
And I should not be woken
I'm the walkin' dead, but I'm just a talkin' head, a zombie floatin'
But I got your mom deep-throatin'
I'm out my Ramen Noodle
We have nothin' in common, poodle
I'm a Doberman, pinch yourself in the arm and pay homage, pupil
It's me, my honesty's brutal
But it's honestly futile if I don't utilize what I do though
For good at least once in a while
So I wanna make sure somewhere in this chicken scratch I scribble and doodle enough rhymes
To maybe try to help get some people through tough times
But I gotta keep a few punchlines
Just in case, 'cause even you unsigned
Rappers are hungry lookin' at me like it's lunchtime
I know there was a time where once I
Was king of the underground
But I still rap like I'm on my Pharoahe Monch grind
So I crunch rhymes, but sometimes when you combine
Appeal with the skin color of mine
You get too big and here they come tryin'
To censor you like that one line
I said on ""I'm Back"" from The Mathers LP 1 when I
Tried to say I'll take seven kids from Columbine
Put 'em all in a line, add an AK-47, a revolver and a 9
See if I get away with it now that I ain't as big as I was, but I'm
Morphin' into an immortal, comin' through the portal
You're stuck in a time warp from 2004 though
And I don't know what the fuck that you rhyme for
You're pointless as Rapunzel with fuckin' cornrows
You write normal? Fuck being normal!
And I just bought a new raygun from the future
Just to come and shoot ya, like when Fabolous made Ray J mad
'Cause Fab said he looked like a fag at Mayweather's pad
Singin' to a man while he played piano
Man, oh man, that was a 24/7 special on the cable channel
So Ray J went straight to the radio station
The very next day, ""Hey Fab, I'ma kill you!""
Lyrics comin' at you at supersonic speed (J.J. Fad)
Uh, summa-lumma, dooma-lumma, you assumin' I'm a human
What I gotta do to get it through to you I'm superhuman?
Innovative and I'm made of rubber so that anything you say is ricochetin' off of me and it'll glue to you and
I'm devastating, more than ever demonstrating
How to give a motherfuckin' audience a feeling like it's levitating
Never fading, and I know the haters are forever waiting
For the day that they can say I fell off, they'll be celebrating
'Cause I know the way to get 'em motivated
I make elevating music, you make elevator music
""Oh, he's too mainstream.""
Well, that's what they do when they get jealous, they confuse it
""It's not hip-hop, it's pop,""—'cause I found a hella way to fuse it
With rock, shock rap with Doc
Throw on ""Lose Yourself"" and make 'em lose it
""I don't know how to make songs like that
I don't know what words to use.""
Let me know when it occurs to you
While I'm rippin' any one of these verses that versus you
It's curtains, I'm inadvertently hurtin' you
How many verses I gotta murder to
Prove that if you were half as nice
Your songs you could sacrifice virgins too?
Ugh, school flunky, pill junkie
But look at the accolades these skills brung me
Full of myself, but still hungry
I bully myself 'cause I make me do what I put my mind to
And I'm a million leagues above you
Ill when I speak in tongues, but it's still tongue-in-cheek, fuck you!
I'm drunk, so, Satan, take the fucking wheel
I'ma sleep in the front seat
Bumpin' Heavy D and the Boyz, still ""Chunky but Funky""
But in my head there's something I can feel tugging and struggling
Angels fight with devils, and here's what they want from me
They're askin' me to eliminate some of the women hate
But if you take into consideration the bitter hatred
I have, then you may be a little patient
And more sympathetic to the situation
And understand the discrimination
But fuck it, life's handin' you lemons? Make lemonade then!
But if I can't batter the women
How the fuck am I supposed to bake them a cake then?
Don't mistake him for Satan; it's a fatal mistake
If you think I need to be overseas and take a vacation
To trip a broad, and make her fall on her face and
Don't be a retard! Be a king? Think not
Why be a king when you can be a God?",The Marshall Mathers LP2,14.5M,"October 15, 2013"
Ed Sheeran,Shape of You,"[Verse 1]
The club isn't the best place to find a lover
So the bar is where I go
Me and my friends at the table doing shots
Drinking fast and then we talk slow
And you come over and start up a conversation with just me
And trust me I'll give it a chance now
Take my hand, stop, put Van the Man on the jukebox
And then we start to dance, and now I'm singing like

[Pre-Chorus]
Girl, you know I want your love
Your love was handmade for somebody like me
Come on now, follow my lead
I may be crazy, don't mind me
Say, boy, let's not talk too much
Grab on my waist and put that body on me
Come on now, follow my lead
Come, come on now, follow my lead

[Chorus]
I'm in love with the shape of you
We push and pull like a magnet do
Although my heart is falling too
I'm in love with your body
And last night you were in my room
And now my bed sheets smell like you
Every day discovering something brand new
I'm in love with your body
Oh—I—oh—I—oh—I—oh—I
I'm in love with your body
Oh—I—oh—I—oh—I—oh—I
I'm in love with your body
Oh—I—oh—I—oh—I—oh—I
I'm in love with your body
Every day discovering something brand new
I'm in love with the shape of you

[Verse 2]
One week in we let the story begin
We're going out on our first date
You and me are thrifty, so go all you can eat
Fill up your bag and I fill up a plate
We talk for hours and hours about the sweet and the sour
And how your family is doing okay
Leave and get in a taxi, then kiss in the backseat
Tell the driver make the radio play, and I'm singing like

[Pre-Chorus]
Girl, you know I want your love
Your love was handmade for somebody like me
Come on now, follow my lead
I may be crazy, don't mind me
Say, boy, let's not talk too much
Grab on my waist and put that body on me
Come on now, follow my lead
Come, come on now, follow my lead

[Chorus]
I'm in love with the shape of you
We push and pull like a magnet do
Although my heart is falling too
I'm in love with your body
And last night you were in my room
And now my bed sheets smell like you
Every day discovering something brand new
I'm in love with your body
Oh—I—oh—I—oh—I—oh—I
I'm in love with your body
Oh—I—oh—I—oh—I—oh—I
I'm in love with your body
Oh—I—oh—I—oh—I—oh—I
I'm in love with your body
Every day discovering something brand new
I'm in love with the shape of you

Nobody pray for me
It's been that day for me
Waaaaay (Yeah, yeah!)

[Verse 1]
Ayy, I remember syrup sandwiches and crime allowances
Finesse a nigga with some counterfeits, but now I’m countin' this
Parmesan where my accountant lives, in fact I'm downin’ this
D'USSÉ with my boo bae tastes like Kool-Aid for the analysts
Girl, I can buy yo' ass the world with my paystub
Ooh, that pussy good, won't you sit it on my taste bloods?
I get way too petty once you let me do the extras
Pull up on your block, then break it down: we playin' Tetris
A.M. to the P.M., P.M. to the A.M., funk
Piss out your per diem, you just gotta hate 'em, funk
If I quit your BM, I still ride Mercedes, funk
If I quit this season, I still be the greatest, funk
My left stroke just went viral
Right stroke put lil' baby in a spiral
Soprano C, we like to keep it on a high note
It's levels to it, you and I know

Get the fuck off my stage, I'm the Sandman (Sandman)
Get the fuck off my dick, that ain't right
I make a play fucking up your whole life
I'm so fuckin' sick and tired of the Photoshop
Show me somethin' natural like afro on Richard Pryor
Show me somethin' natural like ass with some stretch marks
Still will take you down right on your mama's couch in Polo socks
Ayy, this shit way too crazy, ayy, you do not amaze me, ayy
I blew cool from AC, ayy, Obama just paged me, ayy
I don't fabricate it, ayy, most of y'all be fakin', ayy
I stay modest 'bout it, ayy, she elaborate it, ayy
This that Grey Poupon, that Evian, that TED Talk, ayy
Watch my soul speak, you let the meds talk, ayy
If I kill a nigga, it won't be the alcohol, ayy
I'm the realest nigga after all

Why can't I keep my fingers off it?
Baby, I want you, now-now

Feelin' like an animal with these cameras all in my grill

Talkin' about you be reppin' that Third

Hope you can handle this curve, uh

Beat the box up, like Mike in '97, I bite

Dropped two mixtapes in six months, what bitch working as hard as me?
I don't bother with these hoes, don't let these hoes bother me

I might just feel on your babe, my pussy feel like a lake
He wanna swim with his face, I'm like, ""Okay""
I'll let him get what he want, he buy me Yves Saint Laurent

I say I get the money and go, this shit is hot like a stove
My pussy glitter is gold, tell that lil bitch play her role

Ain't heard my album? Who you sleepin' on?
You should print the lyrics out and have a fuckin' read-along
Ain't a fuckin' sing-along 'less you brought the weed along
Then ju… okay, I got it
Then just drop down and get your eagle on
Or we can stare up at the stars and put the Beatles on
All that shit you talkin' 'bout is not up for discussion
I will pay to make it bigger, I don't pay for no reduction
If it's comin' from a nigga I don't know, then I don't trust it
If you comin' for my head, then motherfucker get to bustin'
Yes, Lord, I don't really say this often
But this long-dick nigga ain't for the long talkin'; I'm beast

[Chorus: 2 Chainz, Drake & Both]
I love bad bitches, that's my fuckin' problem
And yeah, I like to fuck, I got a fuckin' problem
I love bad bitches, that's my fuckin' problem
And yeah, I like to fuck, I got a fuckin' problem
I love bad bitches, that's my fuckin' problem
And yeah, I like to fuck, I got a fuckin' problem
If findin' somebody real is your fuckin' problem
Bring your girls to the crib, maybe we can solve it

[Verse 3: Kendrick Lamar]
Uh, yeah, ho, this the finale
My pep talk turn into a pep rally
Say she from the hood, but she live inside in the valley, now
Vaca'd in Atlanta, then she goin' back to Cali, mmm
Got your girl on my line, world on my line
The irony, I fuck 'em at the same damn time
She eyein' me like a nigga don't exist
Girl, I know you want this dick
Girl, I'm Kendrick Lamar (Uh)
A.K.A. Benz is to me just a car (Uh)
That mean your friends-es need be up to par
See, my standards are pampered by threesomes tomorrow
Mmm, kill 'em all, dead bodies in the hallway
Don't get involved, listen what the crystal ball say

Holla back, I'll do ya; beast

When your head's been drowning underwater
And it's the lightness in the air
When you're there
Chest to chest with a lover
It's holding on, though the road's long
And seeing light in the darkest things
And when you stare at your reflection
Finally knowing who it is
I know that you'll thank God you did

I know where you been, where you are, where you goin'
I know you're the reason I believe in life
What's the day without a little night?
I'm just tryna shed a little light
It can be hard
It can be so hard
But you gotta live right now
You got everything to give right now

Hey, you tell your friends
It was nice to meet them
But I hope I never see them again

I know it breaks your heart
Moved to the city in a broke-down car
And four years, no calls
Now you're lookin' pretty in a hotel bar
And I-I-I can't stop
No, I-I-I can't stop

[Chorus: Andrew Taggart]
So, baby, pull me closer
In the backseat of your Rover
That I know you can't afford
Bite that tattoo on your shoulder
Pull the sheets right off the corner
Of the mattress that you stole
From your roommate back in Boulder

Kendrick Lamar,m.A.A.d city,"[Part I: Produced by Sounwave]

[Intro: Kendrick Lamar & ScHoolboy Q]
If Pirus and Crips all got along
They'd probably gun me down by the end of this song
Seem like the whole city go against me
Every time I'm in the street, I hear—
YAWK! YAWK! YAWK! YAWK!

[Chorus: Kendrick Lamar]
Man down, where you from, nigga?
Fuck who you know—where you from, my nigga?
Where your grandma stay, huh, my nigga?
This m.A.A.d city I run, my nigga

[Verse 1: Kendrick Lamar]
Brace yourself, I'll take you on a trip down memory lane
This is not a rap on how I'm slingin' crack or move cocaine
This is cul-de-sac and plenty Cognac and major pain
Not the drill sergeant, but the stress that weighin' on your brain
It was me, L Boog, and Yan Yan, YG Lucky ride down Rosecrans
It got ugly, wavin' yo' hand out the window – check yourself!
Uh, Warriors and Conans, hope euphoria can slow dance
With society, the driver seat the first one to get killed
Seen a light-skinned nigga with his brains blown out
At the same burger stand where *beep* hang out
Now this is not a tape recorder sayin' that he did it
But ever since that day, I was lookin' at him different
That was back when I was nine, Joey packed the nine
Pakistan on every porch is fine, we adapt to crime
Pack a van with four guns at a time
With the sliding door, fuck is up?
Fuck you shootin' for if you ain't walkin' up, you fuckin' punk?
Pickin' up the fuckin' pump, pickin' off you suckers
Suck a dick or die or sucker punch
A wall of bullets comin' from AK's, AR's, ""Ayy, y'all—duck!""
That's what Momma said when we was eatin' that free lunch
Aw man, goddamn, all hell broke loose
You killed my cousin back in '94, fuck yo' truce!
Now crawl your head in that noose
You wind up dead on the news
Ain't no peace treaty, just piecin' BGs up to pre-approve
Bodies on top of bodies, IVs on top of IVs
Obviously the coroner between the sheets like the Isleys
When you hop on that trolley, make sure your color's correct
Make sure you're corporate or they'll be callin' your mother collect
They say the governor collect all of our taxes, except
When we in traffic and tragic happens, that shit ain't no threat
You movin' backwards if you suggest that you sleep with a TEC
Go buy a chopper and have a doctor on speed dial, I guess
M.A.A.d. city

[Chorus: Kendrick Lamar]
Man down, where you from, nigga?
Fuck who you know—where you from, my nigga?
Where your grandma stay, huh, my nigga?
This m.A.A.d city I run, my nigga

[Bridge: Kendrick Lamar & ScHoolboy Q]

It ain't nothin' but a Compton thang
G-yeah, how we do

[Verse 2: Kendrick Lamar]
Fresh outta school 'cause I was a high school grad'
Sleepin' in the living room of my momma's pad
Reality struck, I seen the white car crash
Hit the light pole, two niggas hopped out on foot and dashed
My pops said I needed a job, I thought I believed him
Security guard for a month and ended up leavin'
In fact, I got fired, 'cause I was inspired by all of my friends
To stage a robbery the third Saturday I clocked in
Projects tore up, gang signs get thrown up
Cocaine laced in marijuana
And they wonder why I rarely smoke now
Imagine if your first blunt had you foamin' at the mouth
I was straight tweakin', the next weekend we broke even
I made allegiance that made a promise to see you bleedin'
You know the reasons but still will never know my life
Kendrick a.k.a. ""Compton's Human Sacrifice""

[Interlude: MC Eiht]
G-yeah, cocaine, weed
Niggas been mixin' shit since the '80s, loc
Sherm sticks, butt-nakeds
Dip, make a nigga flip
Cluck heads all up and down the block and shit
One time's crooked and shit
Block a nigga in
Alondra, Rosecrans, Bullis, it's Compton

[Verse 3: MC Eiht]
I'm still in the hood, loc, yeah that's cool
Shit, the hood took me under, so I follow the rules
But yeah, that's like me, I grew up in the hood where they bang
And niggas that rep colors is doin' the same thang
Pass it to the left so I can smoke on me
A couple drive-by's in the hood lately, shit
Couple of IV's with the fuckin' spray-can
Shots in the crowd, then everybody ran
Crew I'm finna slay, the street life I crave
Shots hit the enemy, hearts turn brave
Mount up, regulators in the whip
Down the boulevard with the pistol grip, yeah
Trip, we in the hood still
So, loc, grab a strap 'cause yeah, it's so real, yeah
Deal with the outcome, a strap in the hand
And a bird and ten grand's where a mothafucka stand

[Verse 4: Kendrick Lamar]
If I told you I killed a nigga at sixteen, would you believe me?
Or see me to be innocent Kendrick you seen in the street
With a basketball and some Now and Laters to eat?
If I mentioned all of my skeletons, would you jump in the seat?
Would you say my intelligence now is great relief?
And it's safe to say that our next generation maybe can sleep
With dreams of bein' a lawyer or doctor
Instead of boy with a chopper that hold the cul-de-sac hostage
Kill 'em all if they gossip
The Children of the Corn, they vandalizin' the option
Of livin' a lie, drown their body with toxins
Constantly drinkin' and drive
Hit the powder, then watch this flame that arrive in his eye
Listen, coward, the concept is aim and then bang it and slide
Out that bitch with deposit, a price on his head, the tithes
Probably go to the projects, I

Last night I left hickeys on her neck
Wait, you just dissed me? I'm perplexed
Insult me in a line, compliment me on the next
Damn, I'm really sorry you want me to have a heart attack
Was watchin' 8 Mile on my NordicTrack
Realized I forgot to call you back
Here's that autograph for your daughter, I wrote it on a Starter cap
Stan, Stan, son
Listen, man, Dad isn't mad
But how you gonna name yourself after a damn gun
And have a man-bun?
The giant's woke, eyes open, undeniable
Supplyin' smoke, got the fire stoked
Say you got me in a scope, but you grazed me
I say one call to Interscope and you're Swayze
Your reply got the crowd yelling, ""Woo!""
So before you die let's see who can out-petty who
With your corny lines (""Slim, you're old"")—ow, Kelly, ooh
But I'm 45 and I'm still outselling you
By 29, I had three albums that had blew
Now let's talk about somethin' I don't really do
Go in someone's daughter's mouth stealin' food
But you're a fuckin' mole hill
Now I'ma make a mountain out of you, woo!
Ho, chill, actin' like you put the chrome barrel to my bone marrow
Gunner? Bitch, you ain't a bow and arrow
Say you'll run up on me like a phone bill, sprayin' lead (Brrt)
Playin' dead, that's the only time you hold still (Hold up)
Are you eating cereal or oatmeal?
What the fuck's in the bowl, milk? Wheaties or Cheerios?
'Cause I'm takin' a shit in 'em, Kelly, I need reading material
…Dictionary…
""Yo, Slim, your last four albums sucked
Go back to Recovery,"" oh shoot, that was three albums ago
What do you know? Oops
Know your facts before you come at me, lil' goof
Luxury, oh, you broke, bitch? Yeah, I had enough money in '02
To burn it in front of you, ho
Younger me? No, you the wack me, it's funny but so true
I'd rather be 80-year-old me than 20-year-old you
'Til I'm hitting old age
Still can fill a whole page with a 10-year-old's rage
Got more fans than you in your own city, lil' kiddy, go play
Feel like I'm babysitting Lil Tay
Got the Diddy okay so you spent your whole day
Shootin' a video just to fuckin' dig your own grave
Got you at your own wake, I'm the billy goat
You ain't never made a list next to no Biggie, no Jay
Next to Taylor Swift and that Iggy ho, you about to really blow
Kelly, they'll be putting your name
Next to Ja, next to Benzino—die, motherfucker!
Like the last motherfucker sayin' Hailie in vain
Alien brain, you Satanist (Yeah)
My biggest flops are your greatest hits
The game's mine again and ain't nothin' changed but the locks
So before I slay this bitch I, mwah, give Jade a kiss
Gotta wake up Labor Day to this (The fuck?)
Bein' rich-shamed by some prick usin' my name for clickbait
In a state of bliss 'cause I said his goddamn name
Now I gotta cock back, aim
Yeah, bitch, pop Champagne to this! (Pop)
It's your moment
This is it, as big as you're gonna get, so enjoy it
Had to give you a career to destroy it
Lethal injection
Go to sleep six feet deep, I'll give you a B for the effort
But if I was three-foot-eleven
You'd look up to me, and for the record
You would suck a dick to fuckin' be me for a second
Lick a ballsack to get on my channel
Give your life to be as solidified
This mothafuckin' shit is like Rambo when he's out of bullets
So what good is a fuckin' machine gun when it's outta ammo?
Had enough of this tatted-up mumble rapper
How the fuck can him and I battle?
He'll have to fuck Kim in my flannel
I'll give him my sandals
'Cause he knows, long as I'm Shady he's gon' have to live in my shadow
Exhausting, letting off on my offspring
Lick a gun barrel, bitch, get off me!
You dance around it like a sombrero, we can all see
You're fuckin' salty
'Cause Young Gerald's balls-deep inside of Halsey
Your red sweater, your black leather
You dress better, I rap better
That a death threat or a love letter?
Little white toothpick
Thinks it's over a pic, I just don't like you, prick
Thanks for dissing me
Now I had an excuse on the mic to write ""Not Alike""
But really I don't care who's in the right
But you're losin' the fight you picked
Who else want it? Kells—attempt fails! Budden—L's!
Fuckin' nails in these coffins as soft as Cottonelle
Killshot, I will not fail, I'm with the Doc still
But this idiot's boss pops pills and tells him he's got skills
But, Kells, the day you put out a hit's the day Diddy admits
That he put the hit out that got Pac killed, ah!
I'm sick of you bein' wack
And still usin' that mothafuckin' Auto-Tune
So let's talk about it (Let's talk about it)
I'm sick of your mumble rap mouth
Need to get the cock up out it
Before we can even talk about it (Talk about it)
I'm sick of your blonde hair and earrings
Just 'cause you look in the mirror and think
That you're Marshall Mathers (Marshall Mathers)
Don't mean you are, and you're not about it
So just leave my dick in your mouth and keep my daughter out it

[Outro]
You fuckin'—oh
And I'm just playin', Diddy
You know I love you",NA,5.8M,"September 14, 2018"

That was this summer when nobody helped
And ever since then, man, I hate myself
Wanna fuckin' end it, pessimistic
All wanna see me with no pot to piss in
But niggas been excited 'bout the grave I'm diggin'
Havin' conversations 'bout my haste decisions
Fuckin' sickenin'; at the same time
Memories surface through the grapevine
'Bout my uncle playin' with a slip knot
Post-traumatic stress got me fucked up
Been fucked up since the couple months they had a nigga locked up

[Chorus: XXXTENTACION & Shiloh Dynasty]
I'll be feelin' pain, I'll be feelin' pain just to hold on
And I don't feel the same, I'm so numb

Faded (Drank), faded (Drank)

[Verse 1]
Now I done grew up 'round some people livin' their life in bottles
Granddaddy had the golden flask
Backstroke every day in Chicago
Some people like the way it feels
Some people wanna kill their sorrows
Some people wanna fit in with the popular, that was my problem
I was in a dark room, loud tunes
Lookin' to make a vow soon
That I'ma get fucked up, fillin' up my cup I see the crowd mood
Changin' by the minute and the record on repeat
Took a sip, then another sip, then somebody said to me

[Chorus]
Nigga, why you babysittin' only two or three shots?
I'ma show you how to turn it up a notch
First you get a swimming pool full of liquor, then you dive in it
Pool full of liquor, then you dive in it
I wave a few bottles, then I watch 'em all flock

Okay, now open your mind up and listen me, Kendrick
I am your conscience, if you do not hear me
Then you will be history, Kendrick
I know that you're nauseous right now
And I'm hopin' to lead you to victory, Kendrick
If I take another one down
I'ma drown in some poison, abusin' my limit
I think that I'm feelin' the vibe, I see the love in her eyes
I see the feelin', the freedom is granted
As soon as the damage of vodka arrived
This how you capitalize, this is parental advice
Then apparently, I'm over-influenced by what you are doin'
I thought I was doin' the most 'til someone said to me

Nigga, why you babysittin' only two or three shots?
I'ma show you how to turn it up a notch

All I have in life is my new appetite for failure
And I got hunger pain that grow insane
Tell me, do that sound familiar?
If it do, then you're like me
Makin' excuse that your relief
Is in the bottom of the bottle and the greenest indo leaf
As the window open I release
Everything that corrode inside of me
I see you jokin', why you laugh?
Don't you feel bad? I probably sleep
And never ever wake up, never ever wake up, never ever wake up
In God I trust, but just when I thought I had enough

Ed Sheeran,Perfect,"[Verse 1]
I found a love for me
Oh darling, just dive right in and follow my lead
Well, I found a girl, beautiful and sweet
Oh, I never knew you were the someone waiting for me
'Cause we were just kids when we fell in love
Not knowing what it was
I will not give you up this time
But darling, just kiss me slow, your heart is all I own
And in your eyes, you're holding mine

[Chorus]
Baby, I'm dancing in the dark with you between my arms
Barefoot on the grass, listening to our favourite song
When you said you looked a mess, I whispered underneath my breath
But you heard it, darling, you look perfect tonight

[Verse 2]
Well I found a woman, stronger than anyone I know
She shares my dreams, I hope that someday I'll share her home
I found a love, to carry more than just my secrets
To carry love, to carry children of our own
We are still kids, but we're so in love
Fighting against all odds
I know we'll be alright this time
Darling, just hold my hand
Be my girl, I'll be your man
I see my future in your eyes

[Chorus 2]
Baby, I'm dancing in the dark, with you between my arms
Barefoot on the grass, listening to our favorite song
When I saw you in that dress, looking so beautiful
I don't deserve this, darling, you look perfect tonight

[Instrumental]

[Chorus 3]
Baby, I'm dancing in the dark, with you between my arms
Barefoot on the grass, listening to our favorite song
I have faith in what I see
Now I know I have met an angel in person
And she looks perfect
I don't deserve this
You look perfect tonight",÷ (Divide),5.4M,"March 3, 2017"
gnash,"i hate u, i love u","[Verse 1: Olivia O'Brien]
Feeling used, but I'm
Still missing you and I can't
See the end of this
Just wanna feel your kiss against my lips
And now all this time is passing by
But I still can't seem to tell you why
It hurts me every time I see you
Realize how much I need you

[Chorus: Olivia O'Brien]
I hate you, I love you
I hate that I love you
Don't want to, but I can't put
Nobody else above you
I hate you, I love you
I hate that I want you
You want her, you need her
And I'll never be her

[Verse 2: gnash]
I miss you when I can't sleep
Or right after coffee or right when I can't eat
I miss you in my front seat
Still got sand in my sweaters
From nights we don't remember
Do you miss me like I miss you?
Fucked around and got attached to you
Friends can break your heart, too
And I'm always tired, but never of you
If I pulled a you on you, you wouldn't like that shit
I put this reel out, but you wouldn't bite that shit
I type a text, but then I never mind that shit
I got these feelings, but you never mind that shit
Oh oh, keep it on the low
You're still in love with me, but your friends don't know
If you wanted me, you would just say so
And if I were you, I would never let me go

[Chorus: Olivia O'Brien]
I hate you, I love you
I hate that I love you
Don't want to, but I can't put
Nobody else above you
I hate you, I love you
I hate that I want you
You want her, you need her
And I'll never be her

[Verse 3: gnash]
I don't mean no harm, I just miss you on my arm
Wedding bells were just alarms
Caution tape around my heart
You ever wonder what we could have been?
You said you wouldn't and you fucking did
Lie to me, lie with me, get your fucking fix
Now all my drinks and all my feelings are all fucking mixed
Always missing people that I shouldn't be missing
Sometimes you gotta burn some bridges just to create some distance
I know that I control my thoughts and I should stop reminiscing
But I learned from my dad that it's good to have feelings
When love and trust are gone
I guess this is moving on
Everyone I do right does me wrong
So every lonely night, I sing this song

[Chorus: Olivia O'Brien with gnash]
I hate you, I love you
I hate that I love you
Don't want to, but I can't put
Nobody else above you
I hate you, I love you
I hate that I want you
You want her, you need her
And I'll never be her

[Bridge: Olivia O'Brien with gnash]
All alone, I watch you watch her
Like she's the only girl you've ever seen
You don't care, you never did
You don't give a damn about me
Yeah, all alone, I watch you watch her
She is the only thing you've ever seen
How is it you never notice
That you are slowly killing me?

[Chorus: Olivia O'Brien]
I hate you, I love you
I hate that I love you
Don't want to, but I can't put
Nobody else above you
I hate you, I love you
I hate that I want you
You want her, you need her
And I'll never be her",us - EP,5.3M,"February 17, 2016"
Queen,Bohemian Rhapsody,"[Intro]
Is this the real life? Is this just fantasy?
Caught in a landslide, no escape from reality
Open your eyes, look up to the skies and see
I'm just a poor boy, I need no sympathy
Because I'm easy come, easy go, little high, little low
Any way the wind blows doesn't really matter to me, to me

[Verse 1]
Mama, just killed a man
Put a gun against his head, pulled my trigger, now he's dead
Mama, life had just begun
But now I've gone and thrown it all away
Mama, ooh, didn't mean to make you cry
If I'm not back again this time tomorrow
Carry on, carry on as if nothing really matters

[Verse 2]
Too late, my time has come
Sends shivers down my spine, body's aching all the time
Goodbye, everybody, I've got to go
Gotta leave you all behind and face the truth
Mama, ooh (Anyway the wind blows)
I don't wanna die
I sometimes wish I'd never been born at all

[Verse 3]
I see a little silhouetto of a man
Scaramouche, Scaramouche, will you do the Fandango?
Thunderbolt and lightning, very, very frightening me
(Galileo) Galileo, (Galileo) Galileo, Galileo Figaro magnifico
But I'm just a poor boy, nobody loves me
He's just a poor boy from a poor family
Spare him his life from this monstrosity
Easy come, easy go, will you let me go?
Bismillah! No, we will not let you go
(Let him go!) Bismillah! We will not let you go
(Let him go!) Bismillah! We will not let you go
(Let me go) Will not let you go
(Let me go) Will not let you go
(Let me go) Ah
No, no, no, no, no, no, no
(Oh, mamma mia, mamma mia) Mamma mia, let me go
Beelzebub has a devil put aside for me, for me, for me!

[Verse 4]
So you think you can stone me and spit in my eye?
So you think you can love me and leave me to die?
Oh, baby, can't do this to me, baby!
Just gotta get out, just gotta get right outta here!

Sippin' from a Grammy, walkin' in the buildin'
Diamond in the ceilin', marble on the floors
Beach inside the window, peekin' out the window
Baby in the pool, godfather goals
Only Lord knows I've been goin' hammer
Dodgin' paparazzi, freakin' through the cameras
Eat at Four Daughters, Brock wearin' sandals
Yoga on a Monday, stretchin' to Nirvana
Watchin' all the snakes, curvin' all the fakes
Phone never on, I don't conversate
I don't compromise, I just penetrate
Sex, money, murder—these are the breaks
These are the times, level number 9
Look up in the sky, 10 is on the way
Sentence on the way, killings on the way
Motherfucker, I got winners on the way
You ain't shit without a body on your belt
You ain't shit without a ticket on your plate
You ain't sick enough to pull it on yourself
You ain't rich enough to hit the lot and skate
Tell me when destruction gonna be my fate
Gonna be your fate, gonna be our faith
Peace to the world, let it rotate
Sex, money, murder—our DNA

Pray the real live forever, man
Pray the fakes get exposed
I want that Ferrari, then I swerve
I want that Bugatti, just to hurt
I ain't rockin' my jewelry, that's on purpose
Niggas want my spot and don't deserve it
I don't like how serious they take themselves
I've always been me, I guess I know myself
Shakiness, man, I don't have no time for that
My city too turned up, I'll take the fine for that
This been where you find me at
That's been where you find me at
I know a nigga named Johnny Bling
He put me on to the finer things
Had a job sellin' Girbaud jeans
I had a yellow TechnoMarine

They so irrational, they don't wanna patch it up
They wanna mash it up, woah

I'm way up, I stay up, I'm two up, I'm three up
I had to get back to you, woah
I'm turnin' into a nigga that thinks about money and women

Said they killed his only son because of insufficient funds

He said: ""K-Dot, can you pray for me?
It been a fucked up day for me
I know that you anointed, show me how to overcome.""
He was lookin' for some closure
Hopin' I could bring him closer
To the spiritual, my spirit do no better, but I told him
""I can't sugarcoat the answer for you, this is how I feel:
If somebody kill my son, that mean somebody gettin' killed.""
Tell me what you do for love, loyalty, and passion of
All the memories collected, moments you could never touch
I'll wait in front a nigga's spot and watch him hit his block

Pint of lean, pound of weed, and a kilo
I Eurostep past a hater like I'm Rondo
I upgrade your baby mama to a condo
Like Chapo servin' yayo to the gringos
Black Beatle, club close when I say so

[Chorus: Swae Lee]
That girl is a real crowd pleaser
Small world, all her friends know of me
Young bull livin' like an old geezer
Quick release the cash, watch it fall slowly
Frat girls still tryna get even
Haters mad for whatever reason
Smoke in the air, binge drinkin'
They lose it when the DJ drops the needle

[Verse 3: Slim Jxmmi]
She's a good teaser, and we blowin' reefer
Your body like a work of art, baby
Don't fuck with me, I'll break your heart, baby
D&G on me, I got a lot of flavor
15 hundred on my feet, I'm tryna kill these haters
I had haters when I was broke, I'm rich, I still got haters
I had hoes when I was broke, I'm rich, I'm still a player
I wear leather Gucci jackets like it's still the 80s
I've been blowin' OG Kush, I feel a lil' sedated
I can't worry about a broke nigga or a hater
Black Beatle, bitch, me and Paul McCartney related

[Chorus: Swae Lee]
That girl is a real crowd pleaser
Small world, all her friends know of me
Young bull livin' like an old geezer

Original Broadway Cast of Hamilton,Alexander Hamilton,"[AARON BURR]
How does a bastard, orphan, son of a whore and a
Scotsman, dropped in the middle of a forgotten
Spot in the Caribbean by providence, impoverished, in squalor
Grow up to be a hero and a scholar?

[JOHN LAURENS]
The ten-dollar Founding Father without a father
Got a lot farther by working a lot harder
By being a lot smarter
By being a self-starter
By fourteen, they placed him in charge of a trading charter

[THOMAS JEFFERSON]
And every day while slaves were being slaughtered and carted
Away across the waves, he struggled and kept his guard up
Inside, he was longing for something to be a part of
The brother was ready to beg, steal, borrow, or barter

[JAMES MADISON]
Then a hurricane came, and devastation reigned
Our man saw his future drip, dripping down the drain
Put a pencil to his temple, connected it to his brain
And he wrote his first refrain, a testament to his pain

[BURR]
Well, the word got around, they said, “This kid is insane, man”
Took up a collection just to send him to the mainland
“Get your education, don’t forget from whence you came, and
The world's gonna know your name. What’s your name, man?”

[ALEXANDER HAMILTON]
Alexander Hamilton
My name is Alexander Hamilton
And there's a million things I haven't done
But just you wait, just you wait...

[ELIZA HAMILTON]
When he was ten his father split, full of it, debt-ridden
Two years later, see Alex and his mother bed-ridden
Half-dead sittin' in their own sick, the scent thick

[FULL COMPANY EXCEPT HAMILTON (whispering)]
And Alex got better but his mother went quick

[GEORGE WASHINGTON & COMPANY, BOTH]
Moved in with a cousin, the cousin committed suicide
Left him with nothin' but ruined pride, something new inside
A voice saying
“Alex, you gotta fend for yourself.”
He started retreatin' and readin' every treatise on the shelf

[BURR & COMPANY, BOTH]
There would have been nothin’ left to do
For someone less astute
He woulda been dead or destitute
Without a cent of restitution
Started workin', clerkin' for his late mother's landlord
Tradin’ sugar cane and rum and all the things he can’t afford
Scammin' for every book he can get his hands on
Plannin' for the future see him now as he stands on (ooh)
The bow of a ship headed for a new land
In New York you can be a new man

[COMPANY & HAMILTON, WOMEN, MEN]
In New York you can be a new man (Just you wait)
In New York you can be a new man (Just you wait)
In New York you can be a new man
In New York, New York
Just you wait!

[COMPANY]
Alexander Hamilton (Alexander Hamilton)
We are waiting in the wings for you (waiting in the wings for you)
You could never back down
You never learned to take your time!
Oh, Alexander Hamilton (Alexander Hamilton)
When America sings for you
Will they know what you overcame?
Will they know you rewrote the game?
The world will never be the same, oh

[BURR, MEN, & COMPANY]
The ship is in the harbor now
See if you can spot him
Just you wait
Another immigrant
Comin’ up from the bottom
Just you wait
His enemies destroyed his rep
America forgot him

[MULLIGAN/MADISON & LAFAYETTE/JEFFERSON]
We fought with him

[LAURENS/PHILIP]
Me? I died for him

[WASHINGTON]
Me? I trusted him

[ELIZA & ANGELICA & PEGGY/MARIA]
Me? I loved him

[BURR]
And me? I'm the damn fool that shot him

[COMPANY]
There's a million things I haven’t done
But just you wait!

What's your name, man?

Where them niggas pick your pockets
Santa Claus don't miss them stockings
Liquors spillin', pistols poppin'
Bakin' soda YOLA whippin'
Ain't no turkey on Thanksgivin'

I just hope the Lord forgive him
Pots with cocaine residue
Every day I'm hustlin'
What else is a thug to do
When you eatin' cheese from the government?
Gotta provide for my daughter n'em
Get the fuck up out my way, bish
Got that drum and I got them bands
Just like a parade, bish
Drop that work up in the bushes
Hope them boys don't see my stash
If they do, tell the truth
This the last time you might see my ass
From the gardens where the grass ain't cut
Them serpents lurkin', Blood
Bitches sellin' pussy, niggas sellin' drugs
But it's all good
Broken promises, steal your watch
And tell you what time it is
Take your J's and tell you to kick it where a FootLocker is
In the streets with a heater under my Dungarees
Dreams of me gettin' shaded under a money tree

Adele,Hello,"[Verse 1]
Hello, it's me
I was wondering if after all these years you'd like to meet
To go over everything
They say that time's supposed to heal ya, but I ain't done much healing
Hello, can you hear me?
I'm in California dreaming about who we used to be
When we were younger and free
I've forgotten how it felt before the world fell at our feet

[Pre-Chorus 1]
There's such a difference between us
And a million miles

[Chorus]
Hello from the other side
I must've called a thousand times
To tell you, I'm sorry for everything that I've done
But when I call, you never seem to be home
Hello from the outside
At least, I can say that I've tried
To tell you, I'm sorry for breaking your heart
But it don't matter, it clearly doesn't tear you apart anymore

[Verse 2]
Hello, how are you?
It's so typical of me to talk about myself, I'm sorry
I hope that you're well
Did you ever make it out of that town where nothing ever happened?

[Pre-Chorus 2]
It's no secret that the both of us
Are running out of time

[Chorus]
So hello from the other side
I must've called a thousand times
To tell you, I'm sorry for everything that I've done
But when I call, you never seem to be home
Hello from the outside
At least, I can say that I've tried
To tell you, I'm sorry for breaking your heart
But it don't matter, it clearly doesn't tear you apart anymore

[Bridge]
(Highs, highs, highs, highs, lows, lows, lows, lows)
Ooh, anymore
(Highs, highs, highs, highs, lows, lows, lows, lows)
Ooh, anymore
(Highs, highs, highs, highs, lows, lows, lows, lows)
Ooh, anymore
(Highs, highs, highs, highs, lows, lows, lows, lows)
Anymore

[Chorus]
Hello from the other side
I must've called a thousand times
To tell you, I'm sorry for everything that I've done
But when I call, you never seem to be home
Hello from the outside
At least, I can say that I've tried
To tell you, I'm sorry for breaking your heart
But it don't matter, it clearly doesn't tear you apart anymore

Kendrick Lamar,"Bitch, Don’t Kill My Vibe","[Produced by Sounwave]

[Chorus]
I am a sinner who's probably gonna sin again
Lord, forgive me! Lord, forgive me!
Things I don't understand
Sometimes I need to be alone
Bitch, don't kill my vibe!
Bitch, don't kill my vibe!
I can feel your energy from two planets away
I got my drink, I got my music
I would share it, but today I'm yelling
Bitch, don't kill my vibe! Bitch, don't kill my vibe!
Bitch, don't kill my vibe! Bitch, don't kill my vibe!

[Verse 1]
Look inside of my soul and you can find gold and maybe get rich
Look inside of your soul and you can find out it never exist
I can feel the changes
I can feel a new life, I always knew life can be dangerous
I can say that I like a challenge and you tell me it's painless
You don't know what pain is
How can I paint this picture
When the color blind is hangin' with you?
Fell on my face and awoke with a scar
Another mistake livin' deep in my heart
Wear it on top of my sleeve in a flick
I can admit that it did look like yours
Why you resent every making of this?
Tell me your purpose is petty again
But even a small lighter can burn a bridge
Even a small lighter can burn a bridge

[Bridge]
I can feel the changes
I can feel the new people around me just want to be famous
You can see that my city found me
Then put me on stages, to me that's amazin'
To you that's a quick check
With all disrespect, let me say this

[Chorus]
I am a sinner who's probably gonna sin again
Lord, forgive me! Lord, forgive me!
Things I don't understand
Sometimes I need to be alone
Bitch, don't kill my vibe! Bitch, don't kill my vibe!
I can feel your energy from two planets away
I got my drink, I got my music
I would share it, but today I'm yelling
Bitch, don't kill my vibe! Bitch, don't kill my vibe!
Bitch, don't kill my vibe! Bitch, don't kill my vibe!

[Verse 2]
I'm tryin' to keep it alive
And not compromise the feeling we love
You're tryin' to keep it deprived
And only co-sign what radio does
And I'm lookin' right past you
We live in a world, we live in a world on two different axles
You live in a world, you livin' behind the mirror
I know what you scared of
The feeling of feeling emotions inferior
This shit is vital, I know you had to
This shit is vital, I know you had to
Die in a pitiful vain, tell me a watch and a chain
Is way more believable, give me a feasible gain
Rather a seasonal name
I'll let the people know this is somethin' you can blame
On yourselves, you can remain stuck in a box
I'ma break out and then hide every lock
I'ma break out and then hide every lock

[Bridge]
I can feel the changes
I can feel the new people around me just want to be famous
You can see that my city found me
Then put me on stages, to me that's amazin'
To you that's a quick check
With all disrespect, let me say this

[Chorus]
I am a sinner who's probably gonna sin again
Lord, forgive me! Lord, forgive me!
Things I don't understand
Sometimes I need to be alone
Bitch, don't kill my vibe! Bitch, don't kill my vibe!
I can feel your energy from two planets away
I got my drink, I got my music
I would share it, but today I'm yelling
Bitch, don't kill my vibe! Bitch, don't kill my vibe!
Bitch, don't kill my vibe! Bitch, don't kill my vibe!

[Outro]
Bitch, don't kill my vibe!
You ain't heard the Coast like this in a long time
Don't you see that long line?
And they waiting on Kendrick like the first and the fifteenth
Threes in the air, I can see you are in sync
Hide your feelings, hide your feelings
Now what you better do
I'll take your girlfriend and put that pussy on a pedestal
Bitch, don't kill my vibe! Bitch, don't kill my vibe!
Walk out the door and they scream it's alive
My New Year's resolution is to stop all the pollution
Talk too motherfuckin' much, I got my drink, I got my music
I say bitch, don't kill my vibe! Bitch, don't kill my vibe!
Bitch, don't kill my vibe! Bitch, don't kill my vibe!

Now, walk into the club like, ""What up, I got a big cock!""
Nah, I’m just pumped, I bought some shit from a thrift shop
Ice on the fringe is so damn frosty
The people like, ""Damn, that’s a cold ass honkey!""
Rollin' in hella deep, headed to the mezzanine
Dressed in all pink; except my gator shoes, those are green
Draped in a leopard mink, girl standin' next to me
Probably should've washed this, smells like R. Kelly sheets
(Pissssss...) But shit, it was 99 cents!
Fuck it, coppin' it, washin' it
'Bout to go and get some compliments
Passin' up on those moccasins
Someone else has been walkin' in
Bummy and grungy, fuck it, man
I am stunting and flossin' and saving my money
And I'm hella happy; that’s a bargain, bitch!
I'ma take your grandpa's style, I'ma take your grandpa's style
No, for real, ask your grandpa
Can I have his hand-me-downs? (Thank you!)
Velour jumpsuit and some house slippers
Dookie brown leather jacket that I found diggin'
They had a broken keyboard, I bought a broken keyboard
I bought a skeet blanket, then I bought a knee board
Hello, hello, my ace man, my mellow
John Wayne ain't got nothing on my fringe game, hell no
I could take some Pro Wings, make 'em cool, sell those
The sneaker heads would be like, ""Ah, he got the Velcros.""

What you knowin' about wearin' a fur fox skin?

One man's trash, that's another man's come up
Thank your granddad for donatin' that plaid button-

I'm at the Goodwill, you can find me in the bins

Second hand and I'll rock that, motherfucker
The built-in onesie with the socks on the motherfucker
I hit the party and they stop in that motherfucker
They be like, ""Oh, that Gucci? That's hella tight""
I'm like, ""Yo, that's 50 dollars for a t-shirt.""
Limited edition, let's do some simple addition
50 dollars for a t-shirt, that's just some ignorant bitch shit
I call that getting-swindled-and-pimped shit
I call that getting tricked by business
That shirt's hella dough
And having the same one as six other people in this club is a hella don't

I had women on women: yeah, that's bunk-bed bitches
I've done lived more than an 80-year-old man still kickin'
‘Cause they live for some moments, and I live for a livin'
But this for the girls who barely let me get to first base
On some ground ball shit
‘Cause now I run my city on some town hall shit

Champagne just tastes better
They told me I never, boy, never say never
Swear flow special like an infant's first steps
I got paid to reversed debts
Then I finally found a girl that reverse stress
So now I'm talkin' to the reaper to reverse death
Yep, so I can kick it with my granddad, take him for a ride
Show him I made somethin' out myself and not just tried
Show him the house I bought the fam, let him tour inside
No matter how far ahead I get, I always feel behind in my mind
But fuck tryin' and not doin'
‘Cause not doin' is somethin' a nigga not doin'
I said fuck tryin' and not doin'
‘Cause not doin' is somethin' a nigga not doin'
I grew up to Em, B.I.G., and Pac, bitch, and got ruined
So until I got the same crib B.I.G. had in that ""Juicy"" vid

Go against me, you won't stop losin'
From the city where every month is May-Day at home, spray your dome
Niggas get sprayed up like A.K. was cologne for a paycheck or loan
Yeah, I know that shit ain't fair
They say Detroit ain't got a chance, we ain't even got a mayor
You write your name with a Sharpie, I write mine in stone
I knew the world was for the taking and wouldn't take long
We on, tryna be better than everybody that's better than everybody
Rep Detroit, everybody, Detroit vers' everybody
I'm so fuckin' first class I could spit up on every pilot
The city's my Metropolis, feel it, it's metabolic
And I'm over niggas sayin' they're the hottest niggas
Then run to the hottest niggas just to stay hot
I'm one of the hottest because I flame drop
Drop fire, and not because I'm namedroppin', Hall of Fame droppin'
And I ain't takin' shit from nobody unless they're OGs
‘Cause that ain't the way of a OG
So I G-O collect mo' Gs, every dollar
Never changed though, I'm just the new version of old me
Forever hot-headed but never got cold feet
Got up in the game, won't look back at my old seats

I need a bitch so bad that she take up my whole week

And I'm gonna get it even if you're in the way
And if you're in it, better run for Pete's sake
I heard the barbershops be in great debates all the time
'Bout who's the best MC: Kendrick, Jigga, and Nas
Eminem, André 3000; the rest of y'all
New niggas just new niggas, don't get involved
And I ain't rockin' no more designer shit
White T’s and Nike Cortez, this red Corvette's anonymous
I'm usually homeboys with the same niggas I'm rhymin' with
But this is hip-hop, and them niggas should know what time it is
And that goes for Jermaine Cole, Big K.R.I.T., Wale
Pusha T, Meek Millz, A$AP Rocky, Drake
Big Sean, Jay Electron', Tyler, Mac Miller
I got love for you all, but I'm tryna murder you niggas
Tryna make sure your core fans never heard of you niggas
They don't wanna hear not one more noun or verb from you niggas
What is competition? I'm tryna raise the bar high
Who tryna jump and get it? You're better off tryna skydive
Out the exit window of five G5's with five grand
With your granddad as the pilot, he drunk as fuck, tryna land
With the hand full of arthritis and poppin' prosthetic leg
Bumpin' Pac in the cockpit so the shit that pops in his head
Is an option of violence, someone heard the stewardess said
That your parachute is a latex condom hooked to a dread

You could check my name on the books
I Earth Wind & Fire’d the verse, then reigned on the hook
The legend of Dorothy Flowers proclaimed from the roof
The tale of a magnificent king who came from the nooks
Of the wild magnolia, mother of many soldiers
We live by every single word she ever told us
Watch over your shoulders
And keep a tin of beans for when the weather turn the coldest
The Lord is our shepherd, so our cup runneth over
Put your trust in the Lord, but tether your Chevy Nova
I’m spittin' this shit for closure
And God is my witness, so you could get it from Hova
To all you magicians that’s fidgetin' with the cobra
I’m solid as a rock, ‘cause I came from a rock
That’s why I came with the rock
Then signed my name on the Roc
Draw a line around some Earth, then put my name on the plot
‘Cause I endured a lot of pain for everythang that I got
The eyelashes like umbrellas when it rain from the heart
And the tissue is like an angel kissin' you in the dark
You go from blind sight to hindsight
Passion of the Christ, right, to baskin' in the limelight
It take time to get your mind right

Mmm, you see? You see these fine bitches over here?

You damn right I'm right, I can't remember a time I was god-damn wrong
Man, thanks, Lil Boat
Hey man, that's what I'm here for

[Verse 1: KYLE]
I ain't been gettin' high
Well maybe a little, baby, I don't wanna lie
I know when you text me, girl, I don't always reply
Well you're not an angel either, you can't even fly
I noticed, you think that you know shit
All this shade that's comin' at me, I wonder who throws it
They can't see the vision, boy they must be out of focus
That's a real hot album homie, I wonder who wrote it, oh shit
Otay, pray them niggas go away
Always hella clowns around, it look like Cirque Du Soleil
This is not the album either, these are just the throwaways
This shit still so cold when it drop, it's gonna be a mothafuckin' snow day
Ayy, boy is good and he knows it, he don't say it, he shows it
I'm just like DeRozan, if I shoot it, it goes in
I'm in Cali just coastin', get 'em so wet they need coasters (facts)
I got a selfie with Oprah (facts), I just ain't never post it
And I'm in my happy place posted, I ain't frowned since '06
I ain't cried since '01, my pad like Six Flags and your house is no fun
You can come back to mine though
Your friend ain't cute, but it's fine though
We gon' end on a high note

A girlie I can get 'cause she don't get too many likes

She said she 21, I might have to I.D. that
All my bitches come in pairs like balls in my nutsack
I remember ridin' around the city in a Hatchback
Lookin' for a problem with my young goblins
I'ma send a model home with her neck throbbin'
I done made so much money that it's non-stoppin'
Got my brothers on my back like the last name
I remember tellin' everyone I couldn't be tamed
Whoa, six months later I had snapped and now I'm in the game
Went from fake chains to diamonds in another lane
Went from ""Can you take me here?"" to screenin' out the lane
Went from ""Damn this nigga lame"" to remember my name
So I remember all the people who ain't fucked with me
They went to college, now all them niggas is history
Upgraded from gold to diamonds in my teeth
Ridin' deep in the van, like we lookin' for a mystery (Raggy!)
So don't fuck with me
No, lately I been livin' like luxury
Boat and Kyle stick together like piano keys
And on my mother's mother, I won't fuck a bitch without a damn rubber

Eminem,The Monster,"[Intro: Rihanna]
I'm friends with the monster that's under my bed
Get along with the voices inside of my head
You're tryin' to save me, stop holdin' your breath
And you think I'm crazy, yeah, you think I'm crazy

[Verse 1: Eminem]
I wanted the fame but not the cover of Newsweek
Oh well, guess beggars can't be choosey
Wanted to receive attention for my music
Wanted to be left alone in public, excuse me
For wantin' my cake, and eat it too, and wantin' it both ways
Fame made me a balloon ‘cause my ego inflated
When I blew, see, but it was confusing
‘Cause all I wanted to do's be the Bruce Lee of loose leaf
Abused ink, used it as a tool when I blew steam
Whoo! Hit the lottery, ooh-wee
But with what I gave up to get it was bittersweet
It was like winnin' a used mink
Ironic ‘cause I think I'm gettin' so huge I need a shrink
I'm beginnin' to lose sleep: one sheep, two sheep
Goin' coo-coo and kooky as Kool Keith
But I'm actually weirder than you think, ‘cause I'm—

[Chorus: Rihanna (Bebe Rexha)]
I'm friends with the monster that's under my bed
Get along with the voices inside of my head

[Verse 2: Eminem]
Now, I ain't much of a poet
But I know somebody once told me to seize the moment
And don't squander it ‘cause you never know when it all
Could be over tomorrow, so I keep conjurin'
Sometimes I wonder where these thoughts spawn from
Yeah, ponderin'll do you wonders
No wonder you're losin' your mind, the way it wanders
Yodel-odel-ay-hee-hoo! I think it went wanderin' off down yonder
And stumbled onto Jeff VanVonderen
‘Cause I need an interventionist
To intervene between me and this monster
And save me from myself and all this conflict
‘Cause the very thing that I love's killin' me and I can't conquer it
My OCD's conkin' me in the head, keep knockin'
Nobody's home, I'm sleepwalkin'
I'm just relayin' what the voice in my head's sayin'
Don't shoot the messenger, I'm just friends with the—

[Chorus: Rihanna (Bebe Rexha)]
I'm friends with the monster that's under my bed

[Verse 3: Eminem]
Call me crazy, but I have this vision, one day that
I'll walk amongst you a regular civilian
But until then, drums get killed and
I'm comin' straight at MC's, blood gets spilled and
I'll take you back to the days that I'd get on a Dre track
Give every kid who got played that pumped-up feelin'
And shit to say back to the kids who played him
I ain't here to save the fuckin' children
But if one kid out of a hundred million
Who are goin' through a struggle, feels it and relates, that's great!
It's payback, Russell Wilson fallin' way back
In the draft, turn nothin' into somethin', still can make that
Straw into gold, chump, I will spin—Rumpelstiltskin in a haystack
Maybe I need a straightjacket
Face facts: I am nuts for real, but I'm okay with that!
It's nothin', I'm still friends with the—

[Chorus: Rihanna]
I'm friends with the monster that's under my bed

Nothin' like your last guy, he too square for you
He don't smack that ass and pull your hair like that

No role models and I'm here right now
No role models to speak of
Searchin' through my memory, my memory, I couldn't find one
Last night I was gettin' my feet rubbed
By the baddest bitch, not Trina but I swear to God
This bitch'll make you call your girl up
And tell her, ""Hey, what's good?""
""Sorry I'm never comin' home, I'ma stay for good.""
Then hang the phone up and proceed to lay the wood
I came fast like 9-1-1 in white neighborhoods
Ain't got no shame 'bout it
She think I'm spoiled and I'm rich 'cause I can have any bitch
I got defensive and said, ""Nah, I was the same without it.""
But then I thought back, back to a better me
Before I was a B-list celebrity
Before I started callin' bitches ""bitches"" so heavily
Back when you could get a platinum plaque without no melody
You wasn't sweatin' me

Hands up high, hands up high
Tell 'em dim the lights down right now
Put me in the mood
I'm talkin' about dark room, perfume, go, go

[Verse 1: Kendrick Lamar]
I recognize your fragrance
Hold up, you ain't never gotta say shit
Uh, and I know your taste is
A little bit, hmm, high maintenance
Uh, everybody else basic
You live life on an everyday basis
With poetic justice, poetic justice
If I told you that a flower bloomed in a dark room
Would you trust it?
I mean, I write poems in these songs dedicated to you when
You're in the mood for empathy, there's blood in my pen
Better yet, where your friends and 'em?
I really wanna know you all
I really wanna show you off
Fuck that, pour up plenty of champagne
Cold nights when you curse this name
You called up your girlfriends
And y'all curled in that little bitty Range
I heard that she wanna go and party, she wanna go and party
Nigga, don't approach her with that Atari
Nigga, that ain't good game, homie, sorry

But I could never right my wrongs

Know just, know just what you want
Poetic justice, put it in a song, alright

[Verse 2: Drake]
I really hope you play this, 'cause ol' girl, you test my patience
With all these seductive photographs
And all these one-off vacations you've been takin'
Clearly a lot for me to take in, it don't make sense
Young East African girl, you too busy fuckin' with your other man
I was tryna put you on game, put you on a plane
Take you and your momma to the motherland
I could do it, maybe one day
When you figure out you're gonna need someone
When you figure out it's alright here in the city
And you don't run from where we come from
That sound like poetic justice, poetic justice
You were so new to this life, but goddamn, you got adjusted
I mean, I write poems in these songs, dedicated to the fun sex
Your natural hair and your soft skin
And your big ass in that sundress, ooh
Good God, what you doin' that walk for?
When I see that thing move
I just wish we would fight less and we would talk more
They say communication save relations, I can tell
But I can never right my wrongs
Unless I write 'em down for real, P.S

[Chorus: Kendrick Lamar]
You can get it, you can get it
You can get it, you can get it
And I know just, know just, know just
Know just, know just what you want
Poetic justice, put it in a song, alright
You can get it, you can get it
You can get it, you can get it
And I know just, know just, know just
Know just, know just what you want
Poetic justice, put it in a song, alright

[Verse 3: Kendrick Lamar]
Every time I write these words they become a taboo
Makin' sure my punctuation curve, every letter here's true
Livin' my life in the margin and that metaphor was proof
I'm talkin' poetic justice, poetic justice
If I told you that a flower bloomed in a dark room
Would you trust it? I mean, you need to hear this
Love is not just a verb, it's you lookin' in the mirror
Love is not just a verb, it's you lookin' for it, maybe
Call me crazy, we can both be insane
A fatal attraction is common, and what we have common is pain
I mean, you need to hear this, love is not just a verb
And I can see power steerin', sex drive when you swerve
I want that interference, it's coherent, I can hear it
Uh-huh, that's your heartbeat
It either caught me or it called me, uh-huh
Read slow and you'll find gold mines in these lines
Sincerely, yours truly, and right before you go blind, P.S

[Chorus: Kendrick Lamar]
You can get it, you can get it
You can get it, you can get it
And I know just, know just, know just
Know just, know just what you want
Poetic justice, put it in a song

Look, if you had one shot, or one opportunity
To seize everything you ever wanted, in one moment
Would you capture it, or just let it slip?

[Verse 1]
Yo! His palms are sweaty, knees weak, arms are heavy
There's vomit on his sweater already: Mom's spaghetti
He's nervous, but on the surface he looks calm and ready
To drop bombs, but he keeps on forgetting
What he wrote down, the whole crowd goes so loud
He opens his mouth, but the words won't come out
He's choking, how? Everybody's joking now
The clock's run out, time's up, over—blaow!
Snap back to reality, ope there goes gravity, ope
There goes Rabbit, he choked, he's so mad but he won't
Give up that easy, no, he won't have it, he knows
His whole back's to these ropes, it don't matter, he's dope
He knows that but he's broke, he's so stagnant, he knows
When he goes back to this mobile home, that's when it's
Back to the lab again yo, this whole rhapsody
Better go capture this moment and hope it don't pass him, and

[Chorus]
You better lose yourself in the music
The moment, you own it, you better never let it go
You only get one shot, do not miss your chance to blow
This opportunity comes once in a lifetime, yo
You better lose yourself in the music
The moment, you own it, you better never let it go
You only get one shot, do not miss your chance to blow
This opportunity comes once in a lifetime, yo
You better…

[Verse 2]
His soul's escaping through this hole that is gaping
This world is mine for the taking, make me king
As we move toward a New World Order
A normal life is boring; but superstardom's
Close to post-mortem, it only grows harder
Homie grows hotter, he blows, it's all over
These hoes is all on him, coast-to-coast shows
He's known as the Globetrotter, lonely roads
God only knows, he's grown farther from home, he's no father
He goes home and barely knows his own daughter
But hold your nose, 'cause here goes the cold water
These hoes don't want him no mo', he's cold product
They moved on to the next schmoe who flows
He nose-dove and sold nada, and so the soap opera
Is told, it unfolds, I suppose it's old, partner
But the beat goes on: da-da-dom, da-dom, dah-dah, dah-dah

[Chorus]
You better lose yourself in the music
The moment, you own it, you better never let it go
You only get one shot, do not miss your chance to blow
This opportunity comes once in a lifetime, yo
You better lose yourself in the music
The moment, you own it, you better never let it go
You only get one shot, do not miss your chance to blow
This opportunity comes once in a lifetime, yo
You better…

[Verse 3]
No more games, I'ma change what you call rage
Tear this motherfuckin' roof off like two dogs caged
I was playin' in the beginning, the mood all changed
I've been chewed up and spit out and booed off stage
But I kept rhymin' and stepped right in the next cypher
Best believe somebody's payin' the Pied Piper
All the pain inside amplified by the
Fact that I can't get by with my nine-to-
Five and I can't provide the right type of life for my family
'Cause man, these goddamn food stamps don't buy diapers
And there's no movie, there's no Mekhi Phifer, this is my life
And these times are so hard, and it's gettin' even harder
Tryna feed and water my seed, plus teeter-totter
Caught up between bein' a father and a prima donna
Baby mama drama, screamin' on her, too much for me to wanna
Stay in one spot, another day of monotony's
Gotten me to the point I'm like a snail, I've got
To formulate a plot or end up in jail or shot
Success is my only motherfuckin' option—failure's not
Mom, I love you, but this trailer's got
To go; I cannot grow old in Salem's Lot
So here I go, it's my shot: feet, fail me not
This may be the only opportunity that I got

[Chorus]
You better lose yourself in the music
The moment, you own it, you better never let it go
You only get one shot, do not miss your chance to blow
This opportunity comes once in a lifetime, yo
You better lose yourself in the music
The moment, you own it, you better never let it go
You only get one shot, do not miss your chance to blow
This opportunity comes once in a lifetime, yo
You better…

I don't want you monkey-mouth motherfuckers
Sittin' in my throne again
Ayy, ayy, nigga, what's happenin'?
K-Dot back in the hood, nigga!
I'm mad (He mad!), but I ain't stressin'
True friends, one question

[Chorus 1: Kendrick Lamar]
Bitch, where you when I was walkin'?
Now I run the game, got the whole world talkin'
King Kunta, everybody wanna cut the legs off him
Kunta, black man taking no losses, oh yeah
Bitch, where you when I was walkin'?
Now I run the game, got the whole world talkin'
King Kunta, everybody wanna cut the legs off him
When you got the yams—(What's the yams?)

[Verse 1: Kendrick Lamar]
The yam is the power that be
You can smell it when I'm walkin' down the street
(Oh yes, we can, oh yes, we can)
I can dig rappin', but a rapper with a ghost writer?
What the fuck happened? (Oh no!)
I swore I wouldn't tell, but most of y'all sharing bars
Like you got the bottom bunk in a two-man cell (A two-man cell)
Something's in the water (Something's in the water)
And if I gotta brown-nose for some gold
Then I'd rather be a bum than a motherfuckin' baller (Oh yeah!)

[Chorus 1: Kendrick Lamar]
Bitch, where you when I was walkin'?
Now I run the game, got the whole world talkin'
King Kunta, everybody wanna cut the legs off him
King Kunta, black man taking no losses, oh yeah
Bitch, where you when I was walkin'?
Now I run the game, got the whole world talkin'
King Kunta, everybody wanna cut the legs off him
When you got the yams—(What's the yams?)

[Verse 2: Kendrick Lamar]
The yam brought it out of Richard Pryor
Manipulated Bill Clinton with desires
24/7, 365 days times two
I was contemplatin' gettin' off stage
Just to go back to the hood, see my enemy, and say… (Oh yeah)

[Chorus 1: Kendrick Lamar]
Bitch, where you when I was walkin'?
Now I run the game, got the whole world talkin'
King Kunta, everybody wanna cut the legs off him
King Kunta, black man taking no losses, oh yeah

Now I run the game, got the whole world talkin'
King Kunta, everybody wanna cut the legs off him

[Verse 3: Kendrick Lamar]
You goat-mouth mammyfucker
I was gonna kill a couple rappers, but they did it to themselves
Everybody's suicidal, they ain't even need my help
This shit is elementary, I'll probably go to jail
If I shoot at your identity and bounce to the left
Stuck a flag in my city, everybody's screamin', ""Compton!""
I should probably run for mayor when I'm done, to be honest
And I put that on my momma and my baby boo too
20 million walkin' out the court buildin', woo-woo!
Aw, yeah, fuck the judge
I made it past 25, and there I was
A little nappy-headed nigga with the world behind him
Life ain't shit but a fat vagina
Screamin', ""Annie, are you okay? Annie, are you okay?""
Limo tinted with the gold plates
Straight from the bottom, this the belly of the beast
From a peasant to a prince to a motherfuckin' king (Oh yeah)

[Chorus 2: Kendrick Lamar]
Bitch, where you when I was walkin'—*Gunshot*
By the time you hear the next pop
The funk shall be within you—*Gunshot*
Now I run the game, got the whole world talkin'
King Kunta, everybody wanna cut the legs off him
King Kunta, black man taking no losses, oh yeah
Bitch, where you when I was walkin'?
Now I run the game, got the whole world talkin'
King Kunta, everybody wanna cut the legs off him

I'm with a couple bad bitches that'll rip the party
If Quavo the QB, I'm Nick Lombardi
Pull up in the space coupe, I done linked with Marty
I can actually afford to get a pink Bugatti
""Ayo, Nick, didn't you just do a hit with Gotti?""
That too, but my niggas send hits like Gotti

The worst is yet to come
But at least we'll both be beautiful and stay forever young
This I know, yeah, this I know

[Intro: Aziz Ansari]
I'm really stepping up my game
These bitches gotta start paying me for this
Can't get no more free, Randy

[Chorus: Drake]
Got everything, I got everything
I cannot complain, I cannot
I don't even know how much I really made, I forgot, it's a lot
Fuck that, never mind what I got
Nigga don't watch that 'cause I—
Came up, that's all me, stay true, that's all me
No help, that's all me, all me for real
Came up, that's all me, stay true, that's all me
No help, that's all me, all me for real

[Verse 1: 2 Chainz]
Money on my mind, you should think the same
J's on, pinky ring, dogging these hoes, I need quarantine
In the same league, but we don't ball the same
(Ah) She want all the fame, I hear that shit all the time
She said she love me, I said, ""Baby girl, fall in line""
Okay, made a million off a dinner fork, watch me switch it up
Walked in, ""Ill nigga alert! Ill nigga alert!""
You need that work, I got that work, got bitches in my condo
Just bought a shirt that cost a Mercedes-Benz car note
From the A to Toronto, we let the metal go off
And my dick so hard it make the metal detector go off
This that sauce, this that dressing
Givenchy, nigga, God bless you
If having a bad bitch was a crime, I'd be arrested(Tru)

[Chorus: Drake]
Got everything, I got everything
I cannot complain, I cannot
I don't even know how much I really made, I forgot, it's a lot
Fuck that, never mind what I got
Nigga don't watch that 'cause I—
Came up, that's all me, stay true, that's all me
No help, that's all me, all me for real
Came up, that's all me, stay true, that's all me
No help, that's all me, all me for real

[Verse 2: Drake]
I touched down in '86, knew I was the man by the age of 6
I even fucked the girl that used to babysit
But that was years later on some crazy shit
I heard your new shit, nigga hated it
Damon Wayans, homie don't play that shit
I get paid a lot, you get paid a bit
And my latest shit is like a greatest hits
God damn, ain't no wishing over on this side
Y'all don't fuck with us, then we don't fuck with y'all
It's no different over on this side
God damn, should I listen to everybody or myself?
'Cause myself just told myself:
""You're the motherfucking man, you don't need no help""
Cashing checks and I’m bigging up my chest
Y'all keep talking ‘bout who next, but I’m about as big as it gets
I swear y'all just wasting y'all breath
I’m the light skinned Keith Sweat, I'ma make it last forever
It’s not your turn 'cause I ain't done yet
Look, just understand that I'm on a roll like Cottonelle
I was made for all of this shit
And I’m on the road box office sales
I’m getting paid for all of this shit
Ask you to please excuse my table manners
I was making room for the table dancers
'Cause if we judging off your advances
Then I just got paid like eight advances, God damn!

[Chorus: Drake]
Got everything, I got everything
I cannot complain, I cannot
I don't even know how much I really made, I forgot, it's a lot
Fuck that, never mind what I got
Nigga don't watch that 'cause I—
Came up, that's all me, stay true, that's all me
No help, that's all me, all me for real
Came up, that's all me, stay true, that's all me—

[Verse 3: Big Sean]
Ho, shut the fuck up!
I got way too much on my mental
I learn from what I've been through
I'm finna do what I didn't do
And still waking up like the rent's due
Not complicated, it's simple
I got sexy ladies, a whole Benz-full
And to them hoes I'm everything—everything but gentle
But I still take my time, man, I guess I'm just old fashioned
Wearing retro shit, that's old fashion
Nigga, see what I'm saying, no closed caption
I paint pics, see the shit, good sex, need to hit
Keep a broad on the floor year 'round like season tickets
I plead the fifth, drink a fifth, load the nine
Leave you split, in the half, smoke a half, need a zip
My new girl is on Glee and shit
Probably making more money than me and shit
I swear to God I got 99 problems but a bitch ain't one
I got 99 problems, getting rich ain't one
Like I got trust issues
I'm sorry for the people I've pushed out
I'm the type to have a bullet-proof condom
And still gotta pull out
But that's just me and I ain't perfect
I ain't a saint but I am worth it
If it's one thing, I am worth it
Niggas still hating but it ain't working
Lil' bitch...

[Verse 4: Drake]
Oh me, oh me, oh my
I think I done fucked too many women from the 305
'Fore the end of this year
I'll do King of Diamonds 3 more times
Smoking on that kush all in our section
Like it's legalized
Girl, you can't always have your way
Sometimes it be like that
They don't really fuck with you like that
They ain't never did me like that
I just took my time, you got the shine
I let you eat like that
I been taught to never loan somebody
What you need right back
And I need that shit right back
(No more free Randy) I’m blessed than a muhfucka
Niggas been stressed than a muhfucka
Niggas getting nervous
Clutching they chests like a muhfucka
Damn that’s a motherfucker
Tell the truth, I don’t listen to you
'Cause I don’t like being lied to
And that ship won’t sail
And that wind won’t guide you

Like a motherfucking drive-thru

Whoa, Joyner, Joyner, yeah, yeah, yeah

[Bridge: Joyner Lucas]
Yeah, I done did a lot of things in my day, I admit it
I don't take back what I say, if I said it then I meant it
All my life I want a Grammy, but I'll prolly never get it
I ain't never had no trophy or no motherfuckin' ribbon (Yah I said it)
Fuck the system, I'm that nigga, bend the law, cut the rules
I'm about to risk it all, I ain't got too much to lose
Y'all been eatin' long enough, it's my turn to cut the food
Pass the plate! Where my drink? This my day, lucky you
Fuck you too, woo!

[Chorus: Joyner Lucas]
Y'all gotta move, y'all gotta move, y'all gotta move
Give me some room, give me some room, give me the juice

Y'all gotta move, y'all gotta move, give me the juice

[Verse 1: Joyner Lucas]
Back on my bullshit, my back to the wall
Turn my back on you, all of you finished
Back to these bullets, it's back to the job
Pull my MAC out and all of you runnin'
Back on my hood shit, it's back to the pushin'
These packs and I'm actually pumpin'
Can't fuck with you rappers, you practically suckin'
You mighta went platinum but that don't mean nothin'
I'm actually buzzin' this time
Straight out the kitchen, I told 'em the oven is mine
I do not fuck with you guys
If I don't kill you, just know you gon' suffer this time
I ain't no gangster but I got some bangers
Some chains and some blades and a couple of nines
Choppers and jammies, a partridge, a pear tree
My 12 days of Christmas was nothin' but lies
I run at you hard like a sumo (Sumo)
They say I talk like a chulo (Chulo)
I live in Mars, I'm not Bruno (Woo)
Bitch I'm a dog, call me Cujo (Rah)
You play your cards, I reverse on you all
And I might just draw 4 like a Uno (Bup)
Cállate boca mejor, maricón, little puto, and all of you culo (Joyner)
They've invented a level up in the ghetto to get old
Lookin' for somethin' I prolly can never find now
Shit get relevant 'til 'nother beef die down
In truth, a nigga just really want me tied down
I've been alone and I never needed nobody
Just only me and my shotty, I'll tell these niggas to lie down
Keep all the money, I never wanted the lifestyle
I just pray to God that my son'll be alright now
I said ain't no love for the other side
Or anyone who ever want smoke (Joyner)
When I die I'm goin' out as the underdog who never lost hope (Yeah)
You in the wrong cab down the wrong path
Nigga, wrong way, wrong road (Woo, woo)
Snakes in the grass tryna slither fast
I just bought a fuckin' lawn mower (Vroom!)

[Bridge: Eminem]
I done said a lotta things in my day, I admit it
This is payback in a way, I regret it that I did it
I done won a couple Grammys, but I sold my soul to get 'em
Wasn't in it for the trophies, just the fuckin' recognition
Fuck's the difference?
I'm that cracker, bend the law, fuck the rules
Man I used to risk it all, now I got too much to lose
I've been eatin' long enough, man my stomach should be full
I just ate, licked the plate, my buffet, lucky me
Fuck you think? (Woo!)

[Verse 2: Eminem]
I got a couple of mansions
Still I don't have any manners
You got a couple of ghost writers
But to these kids it don't actually matter
They're askin' me, ""What the fuck happened to hip-hop?""
I said, ""I don't have any answers.""
'Cause I took an L when I dropped my last album
It hurt me like hell but I'm back on these rappers
And actually comin' from humble beginnings
I'm somewhat uncomfortable winning
I wish I could say, ""What a wonderful feeling!""
""We're on the upswing like we're punchin' the ceiling!""
But nothin' is feeling like anyone has any fuckin' ability
To even stick to a subject, it's killin' me
The inability to pen humility
Ha-ta-ta ba-ta-ta, why don't we make a bunch of
Fuckin' songs about nothin' and mumble 'em?
Fuck it, I'm goin' for the jugular
Shit is a circus, you clowns that are comin' up
Don't give an ounce of a motherfuck
About the ones that were here before you that made rap
Let's recap, way back, MC's that wreak havoc on tape decks
ADAT's, where the G Raps and Kanes at?
We need 3 Stacks ASAP and bring Masta Ace back
'Cause half of these rappers have brain damage
All the lean rappin', face tats, syruped out like tree sap
I don't hate trap, and I don't wanna seem mad
But in fact, where the old me at? The same cat
That would take that feedback and aim back, I need that
But I think it's inevitable
They know what button to press or what lever to pull
To get me to snap though (Lil' bitch)
And if I pay it attention I'm prob'ly makin' it bigger
But you've been takin' ya digs in the fuckin' back, ho (Get it?)
On the brink, any minute got me thinkin' of finishin'
Everything with acetaminophen and reapin' the benefits
I'm asleep at the wheel again
As I peak into thinkin' about an evil intent
Of another beat I'ma kill again
'Cause even if I gotta end up eatin' a pill again
Even ketamine or methamphetamine with the minithin
It better be at least 70 or 300 milligram
And I might as well 'cause I'ma end up bein' a villain again
Levels to this shit, I got an elevator
You could never say to me I'm not a fuckin' record breaker
I sound like a broken record every time I break a record
Nobody could ever take away the legacy I made, I never cater
Motherfucker, now I got a right to be this way
I got spite inside my DNA
But I wrote 'til the wheels fall off, I'm workin' tirelessly, ayy
It's the moment y'all been waitin' for
Like California wishin' rain to pour
In that drought, y'all been prayin' for
My downfall from the 8 Mile to the Southpaw
Still the same Marshall, that outlaw
That they say as a writer might've fell off
I'm back on that bull like the cowboy

[Chorus: Joyner Lucas & Eminem]
So y'all gotta move (Yeah), y'all gotta move (Yeah), y'all gotta move
Give me some room, give me some room, give me the juice
Hop out the coupe, hop out the coupe, hop out and shoot
Y'all gotta move, y'all gotta move, give me the juice",Kamikaze,3.7M,"August 31, 2018"

So why send oppression not blessings?
Why, oh, why'd you do me wrong? (More)

So I look to the light (War)
To make these wrongs turn right
Head up high, I look to the light
Hey, 'cause I know that you'll make everything alright
And I know that you'll take good care of your child
Oh, no longer am afraid of the night
'Cause I, I look to the light

When they come for you, I will shield your name
I will field their questions, I will feel your pain
No one can judge

They don't know
Foot on the Devil's neck 'til it drifted Pangaea
I'm moving all my family from Chatham to Zambia
Treat the demons just like Pam
I mean I fuck with your friends, but damn, Gina
I been this way since Arthur was anteater
Now they wanna hit me with the woo wap, the bam
Tryna snap photos of familia
My daughter look just like Sia, you can't see her
You can feel the lyrics, the spirit coming in braille
Tubman of the underground, come and follow the trail
I made Sunday Candy, I'm never going to hell
I met Kanye West, I'm never going to fail
He said, ""Let's do a good ass job with 'Chance 3'""
I hear you gotta sell it to snatch the Grammy
Let's make it so free and the bars so hard
That there ain't one gosh darn part you can't tweet
This is my part, nobody else speak
This is my part, nobody else speak
This little light of mine
Glory be to God, yeah
I'ma make sure that they go where they can't go
If they don't wanna ride I'ma still give 'em raincoats
Know what God said when he made the first rainbow
Just throw this at the end if I'm too late for the intro
Ugh, I'm just having fun with it
You know that a nigga was lost
I laugh in my head
'Cause I bet that my ex looking back like a pillar of salt
Ugh, 'cause they'll flip the script on your ass like Wesley and Spike
You cannot mess with the light
Look at lil' Chano from 79th

Father, this prayer is for everyone that feels they're not good enough
This prayer's for everybody that feel that they're too messed up

[Verse 1: J. Cole]
Okay, back when I was sleeping in my mama crib
Or even back when I was up there in Mohammed crib
Paying seventeen-hundred for the rent, money well-spent
No heater, but a nigga made heat, may I vent?
Had a thing for ya, even wrote the song ""Dreams"" for ya
‘Cause I had dreams for ya, thoughts of a ring for ya
Childish shit, you know child and shit
Anonymous flowers sent, you know coward shit
Now a nigga signed to Hov, took a power trip
Back home, I'm grown now, and the city's my throne now, huh
The same clubs that I used to get tossed out
Life got Kriss Kross'd: totally crossed out
‘Cause now I'm in this bitch and I'm totally bossed out
Old chicks crying ‘cause they know that they lost out
But I'm still on you, I'm still on you
My drink spill on me, while I feel on you, I'm sayin'—

[Pre-Chorus: Miguel]
Would you believe me if I said I'm in love?
Baby, I want you to want me
Would you believe me if I said I'm in love?
Baby, I want ya

And we are, we are, we are (She got me)

[Verse 2: J. Cole]
Well, this has got to be the longest crush ever
If I ever get to fuck it'd be the longest bust ever
Love is a drug, like the strongest stuff ever and
Fuck it, I'm on one, you feel me?
She on a power trip, she got me where she want a nigga
Wife'ing in the club, man, my homies gon' disown a nigga
Like, ""Give me 20 dollars, dollars!""
Ass stupid, how you get to college, college?
I'm in your city and I'm wonderin' if you're home now
Went and found a man, but I'm hopin' you're alone now
Can't help but feeling like I dropped the ball, cliché
I used to pop up on you at the mall each day
Now, typically I kick game like East Bay
But you got a nigga freeze-framed yelling: ""Please play!""
For Pete's sake, homie, pull it together
Just fuck her one time and be through with forever, but—

[Pre-Chorus: Miguel]
Would you believe me if I said I'm in love?
Baby, I want you to want me
Would you believe me if I said I'm in love?
Baby, I want ya, yeah

You think you broke my heart, oh girl for goodness sake
You think I'm cryin' on my own, well I ain't

And I think you should be somethin'
I don't wanna hold back
Maybe you should know that

My mama don't like you and she likes everyone
And I never like to admit that I was wrong
And I've been so caught up in my job, didn't see what's going on
But now I know, I'm better sleeping on my own

'Cause if you like the way you look that much
Oh baby you should go and love yourself
And if you think that I'm still holdin' on to somethin'
You should go and love yourself

The only problem was with you and not them
And every time you told me my opinion was wrong
And tried to make me forget where I came from

I fell in love, now I feel nothin' at all
I never felt so low and I was vulnerable
Was I a fool to let you break down my walls?

Return of the Mack
Get 'em, what it is, what it does, what it is, what it isn't
Looking for a better way to get up outta bed
Instead of getting on the Internet
And checking on who hit me, get up
Thrift shop, pimp-strut walkin'
Little bit of humble, little bit of cautious
Somewhere between like Rocky and Cosby
Sweater game, nope nope, y'all can't copy, yeah
Bad, moonwalking, this here is our party
My posse's been on Broadway, and we did it our way
Grown music, I shed my skin and put my bones
Into everything I record to it and yet I'm on
Let that stage light go and shine on down
Got that Bob Barker suit game and Plinko in my style
Money, stay on my craft and stick around for those pounds
But I do that to pass the torch and put on for my town
Trust me on my I-N-D-E-P-E-N-D-E-N-T shit, hustlin'
Chasing dreams since I was fourteen
With the four-track, bussin'
Halfway cross that city with the backpack, fat cat, crushin'
Labels out here, now they can't tell me nothin' (Hey, hey, hey)
We give that to the people, spread it across the country (Hey, hey, hey, oh)

Can we go back? This is the moment
Tonight is the night, we'll fight 'til it's over
So we put our hands up
Like the ceiling can't hold us

[Verse 2: Macklemore]
Now, can I kick it? Thank you
Yeah, I'm so damn grateful
I grew up really wanting gold fronts
But that’s what you get when Wu-Tang raised you
Y'all can't stop me
Go hard like I got a 808 in my heartbeat
And I'm eating at the beat like you gave a little speed
To a great white shark on Shark Week, raw!
Time to go off, I'm gone
Deuces, goodbye, I got a world to see
And my girl, she wanna see Rome
Caesar'll make you a believer
Nah, I never ever did it for a throne
That validation comes from giving it back to the people
Now sing a song, and it goes like
Raise those hands, this is our party (Hey, hey, hey)
We came here to live life like nobody was watching (Hey, hey, hey, oh)
I got my city right behind me, if I fall, they got me (Hey, hey, hey)
Learn from that failure, gain humility (Hey, hey, hey)
And then we keep marching, I said

Can we go back? This is the moment
Tonight is the night, we'll fight 'til it's over
So we put our hands up

Is it bad that I never made love?
No, I never did it
But I sure know how to fuck
I'll be your bad girl, I'll prove it to ya

Bad girls ain't no good, and the good girls ain't no fun
And the hood girls want a smart nigga
College girls all want a thug
So it seems that we fiend what we don't need
Got a thing for a queen who know when to leave
I ain't bout to judge you, don't judge me
You ain't gotta really sing about your rap sheet
'Cause I heard you (bad, nooo)
In the literal sense I mean that
Rough sex, sayin' I love ya
But to kiss them is sayin' you mean that (bad, nooo)
I know, I just be callin' her mean-ass
Oh the irony, got the bomb indeed
But the problem is probably a deep past
Still I'm feelin' of somethin' I need bad
Thinkin' if I get her, I get her to need this
I don't need emotions to open your deep sea

Ridin' through lake shore with the nose up
She don't really date much, but it slows her up
She got haters, but we all do
Heard you're winter-time cold, shawty, fall through
Baby, look at they approach, how they court you
All those minds games, nevermind, 'cause they all lose

I ain't tryna kiss up, suck up, feed gas
I ain't like them nigga you suckin' your teeth at, nope
Play big, trust me I'll humble yo' mean-ass

And I'm 'bout to take it to another level, bitch

Do the rap and the track, triple double, no assists
And my only focus is staying on some bogus shit
Arguing with my older bitch, acting like I owe her shit
I heard that people sing raps to give the track pain
Bought the chain that always give me back pain
Fucking up my money so, yeah, I had to act sane

If you wanna make your number one your number two now""

Know that motherfucker well: ""What you gon' do now?""
Whatever I wanna do, gosh! It's cool now
Know I'm gonna do, ah, it's the new now
Think you motherfuckers really really need to cool out
'Cause you'll never get on top of this
So mommy, best advice is just to get on top of this
Have you ever had sex with a pharaoh?
Ahh, put the pussy in a sarcophagus

All I get is these vampires and blood-suckers
All I see is these niggas I made millionaires
Milling about, spilling they feelings in the air
All I see is these fake fucks with no fangs
Tryna draw blood from my ice-cold veins
I smell a massacre
Seems to be the only way to back you bastards up

[Chorus: Kanye West]
Gossip, gossip, nigga, just stop it
Everybody know I'm a motherfucking monster
I'ma need to see your fucking hands at the concert
I'ma need to see your fucking hands at the concert
Profit, profit, nigga, I got it
Everybody know I'm a motherfucking monster
I'ma need to see your fucking hands at the concert

[Verse 3: Nicki Minaj]
Pull up in the monster, automobile gangsta
With a bad bitch that came from Sri Lanka
Yeah I'm in that Tonka, color of Willy Wonka
You could be the king but watch the queen conquer
Okay, first things first, I'll eat your brains
Then I'ma start rocking gold teeth and fangs
'Cause that's what a motherfucking monster do
Hair dresser from Milan, that's the monster 'do
Monster Giuseppe heel, that's the monster shoe
Young Money is the roster and a monster crew
And I'm all up, all up, all up in the bank with the funny face
And if I'm fake, I ain't notice 'cause my money ain't
So let me get this straight, wait, I'm the rookie?
But my features and my shows ten times your pay?
50K for a verse, no album out
Yeah, my money's so tall that my Barbies got to climb it
Hotter than a Middle Eastern climate, violent
Tony Matterhorn, ""Dutty Wine"" it, wylin'
Nicki on them titties when I sign it
That's how these niggas so one-track-minded
But really, really I don't give a F-U-C-K
""Forget Barbie, fuck Nicki 'cause she's fake""
""She on a diet,"" but my pockets eating cheesecake
And I'll say, bride of Chucky, it's Child's Play
Just killed another career, it's a mild day
Besides, 'Ye, they can't stand besides me
I think me, you, and Am should ménage Friday
Pink wig, thick ass, give 'em whiplash
I think big, get cash, make 'em blink fast
Now look at what you just saw, this is what you live for
Aaaah, I'm a motherfucking monster!

[Outro: Bon Iver]
I, I crossed the limelight
And I'll, I'll let God decide
And I, I wouldn't last these shows
So I, I am headed home
I, I crossed the limelight
And I'll, I'll let God decide
And I, I wouldn't last these shows
So I, I am headed home
I, I crossed the limelight
And I'll, I'll let God decide
And I, I wouldn't last these shows

I'm talkin' George Tenet, I seen him the other day
He asked me about my Maybach, think he had the same

Or maybe they get money, buy a business
I rather buy 80 gold chains and go ign'ant

Blame it on the pigment, we livin' no limits
Them gold Master P ceilings was just a figment

Now I'm lookin' at a crib right next to where TC lives
That's Tom Cruise, whatever she accuse
He wasn't really drunk, he just had a frew brews
Pass the refreshments, a cool, cool beverage
Everything I do need a news crew's presence
Speedboat swerve, homie, watch out for the waves
I'm way too black to burn from sunrays
So I just meditate at the home in Pompeii
About how I could build a new Rome in one day
Every time I'm in Vegas they screamin' like he's Elvis
But I just wanna design hotels and nail it
Shit is real, got me feelin' Israelian
Like Bar Refaeli, or Gisele—no, that's Brazilian

I felt it from the first embrace I shared with you
That now our dreams
They've finally come true

City of stars
Just one thing everybody wants
There in the bars
And through the smokescreen of the crowded restaurants
It's love
Yes, all we're looking for is love from someone else
A rush
A glance
A touch
A dance

A look in somebody's eyes
To light up the skies
To open the world and send it reeling
A voice that says, ""I'll be here""
And ""you'll be alright""

Just where I will go
'Cause all that I need is this crazy feeling
A rat-tat-tat on my heart

Let me explain just how to make greatness
Straight out the gate, I'm ’bout to break it down
Ain't no mistakes allowed, but make no mistake, I'm 'bout
To rape the alphabet, I may raise some brows
If I press the issue just to get the anger out (Brrr!)
Full magazine could take Staples out
Savage but ain't thinkin' 'bout no bank account
But bitch, I'm off the chain like Kala Brown
Motherfucker, shut the fuck up when I’m talkin’, lil' bitch
I’m sorry, wait, what's your talent? Oh, critiquin'
My talent? Oh, bitch, I don't know who the fuck y’all are
To give a sub-par bar or even have an opinion or view
You mention me, millions of views, attention in news
I mention you, lose-lose for me, win-win for you
Billions of views, your ten cents are two
Skim through the music to give shit reviews
To get clicks, but bitch, you just lit the fuse
Don't get misconstrued, business as us'
Shit-list renewed, so get shit to do
Or get dissed 'cause I just don't get
What the fuck half the shit is that you're listenin' to
Do you have any idea how much I hate this choppy flow
Everyone copies though? Prob'ly no
Get this fuckin' audio out my Audi, yo, adiós
I can see why people like Lil Yachty, but not me though
Not even dissin', it just ain't for me
All I am simply is just an emcee
Maybe ""Stan"" just isn't your cup of tea (Get it?)
Maybe your cup's full of syrup and lean
Maybe I need to stir up shit, preferably
Shake the world up if it were up to me
Paul wants me to chill, y'all want me to ill
I should eat a pill, probably I will
Old me killed the new me, watch him bleed to death
I breathe on the mirror, I don't see my breath
Possibly I'm dead, I must be possessed
Like an evil spell, I'm E-V-I-L (Evil, spelled)
Jam a Crest Whitestrip in the tip of my dick
With an ice pick, stick it in a vise grip
Hang it on a spike fence, bang it with a pipe wrench
While I take my ball sack and flick it like a light switch
Like Vice President Mike Pence
Back up on my shit in a sidekick as I lay it on a spike strip
These are things that I'd rather do than hear you on a mic
Since nine tenths of your rhyme is about ice and
Jesus Christ, man, how many times is
Someone gonna fuck on my bitch? (Fuck my side chick!)
You won't ever see Em icy
But as cold as I get on the M-I-C
I polarize shit, so the Thames might freeze
And your skull might split like I bashed you upside it
Bitch, I got the club on smash like a nightstick (Yeah)
Turn down for what?
I ain't loud enough, nah, turn the Valium up!
'Cause I don't know how I'm gonna get your mouths to shut
Now when it doesn't matter what caliber
I spit at, I'll bet a hundred thousand bucks
You'll turn around and just be like, ""Man, how the fuck
Sourpuss gonna get mad just 'cause his album sucks?
And now he wants to take it out on us"" (Ooouuu)
But last week, an ex-fan mailed me a copy
Of The Mathers LP to tell me to study
It'll help me get back to myself and she'll love me (Oooouuu)
I mailed the bitch back and said if I did that
I'd just be like everyone else in the fuckin' industry
Especially an effing Recovery clone of me (NFing)
So finger-bang, chicken wang, MGK, Igg' Azae'
Lil Pump, Lil Xan imitate Lil Wayne
I should aim at everybody in the game, pick a name
I'm fed up with bein' humble
And rumor is I'm hungry, I'm sure you heard rumblings
I heard you wanna rumble like an empty stomach
I heard your mumblin' but it's jumbled in mumbo-jumbo
The era that I'm from will pummel you, that's what it's comin' to
What the fuck you're gonna do when you run into it?
I'm gonna crumble you and I'll take a number two
And dump on you, if you ain't Joyner
If you ain't Kendrick or Cole or Sean, then you're a goner
I'm 'bout to bring it to anyone in this bitch who want it
I guess when you walk into BK you expect a Whopper
You can order a Quarter Pounder when you go to McDonald's
But if you're lookin' to get a porterhouse you better go get Revival
But y'all are actin' like I tried to serve you up a slider
Maybe the vocals shoulda been auto-tuned
And you woulda bought it
But sayin' I no longer got it
'Cause you missed a line and never caught it
'Cause it went over your head, because you're too stupid to get it
'Cause you're mentally retarded, but pretend to be the smartest
With your expertise and knowledge, but you'll never be an artist
And I'm harder on myself than you could ever be regardless
What I'll never be is flawless, all I'll ever be is honest
Even when I'm gone they're gonna say I brought it
Even when I hit my forties like a fuckin' alcoholic
With a bottle full of malt liquor
But I couldn't bottle this shit any longer
The fact that I know that I'ma hit my bottom
If I don't pull myself from the jaws of defeat and rise to my feet
I don't see why y'all even started with me
I get in beefs, my enemies die
I don't cease fire 'til at least all are deceased
I'm east side, never be caught slippin'
Now you see why I don't sleep, not even a wink, I don't blink
I don't doze off, I don't even nod to the beats
I don't even close my fuckin' eyes when I sneeze
""Aw, man! That BET cypher was weak, it was garbage
The Thing ain't even orange—oh my God, that's a reach!""
Shout to all my colorblind people
Each and everyone of y'all, if you call a fire engine green
Aquamarine, or you think water is pink
""Dawg, that's a date."" ""Looks like an olive to me.""
""Look, there's an apple!"" No, it's not, it's a peach!
So finger-bang, Pootie Tang
Burger King, Gucci Gang, dookie, dang
Charlamagne gonna hate anyway, doesn't matter what I say
Give me Donkey of the Day
What a way for 2018 to get underway
But I'm gonna say everything that I wanna say
Welcome to the slaughterhouse, bitch! (Yeah)
Invite 'em in like a One A Day
I'm not done (Preach!)
'Cause I feel like the beast of burden
That line in the sand, was it even worth it?
'Cause the way I see people turning's
Makin' it seem worthless, it's startin' to defeat the purpose
I'm watchin' my fan base shrink to thirds
And I was just tryin' to do the right thing, but word
Has the court of public opinion reached a verdict
Or still yet to be determined?
'Cause I'm determined to be me, critiqued or worshipped
But if I could go back, I'd at least reword it
And say I empathize with the people this evil serpent
Sold the dream to that he's deserted
But I think it's workin'
These verses are makin' him a wee bit nervous
And he's too scurred to answer me with words
'Cause he knows that he will lyrically get murdered
But I know at least he's heard it
'Cause Agent Orange just sent the Secret Service
To meet in person to see if I really think of hurtin' him
Or ask if I'm linked to terrorists
I said, ""Only when it comes to ink and lyricists.""
But my beef is more media journalists
(Hold up, hold up, hold up…)
I said my beef is more meaty, a journalist
Can get a mouthful of flesh
And yes, I mean eatin' a penis
'Cause they been pannin' my album to death
So I been givin' the media fingers
Don't wanna turn this to a counseling sesh
But they been puttin' me through the ringer
So I ain't ironin' shit out with the press
But I just took this beat to the cleaners",Kamikaze,3.5M,"August 31, 2018"

[Part I: 0 to 100]

[Verse 1]
Fuck bein' on some chill shit
We go 0 to 100, nigga, real quick
They be on that rap-to-pay-the-bill shit
And I don't feel that shit, not even a little bit
Oh Lord, know yourself, know your worth, nigga
My actions been louder than my words, nigga
How you so high, but still so down to Earth, nigga?
If niggas wanna do it, we can do it on they turf, nigga
Oh Lord, I'm the rookie and the vet
Shoutout to the bitches out here holdin' down the set
All up in my phone, lookin' at pictures from the other night
She gon' be upset if she keep scrollin' to the left, dawg
She gon' see some shit that she don't wanna see
She ain't ready for it
If I ain't the greatest then I'm headed for it
That mean I'm way up (way up)
Yeah, the 6 ain't friendly but that's where I lay up
This shit a mothafuckin' lay up
I been Steph Curry with the shot
Been cookin' with the sauce, Chef Curry with the pot, boy
360 with the wrist, boy
Who the fuck them niggas is, boy?
OVO, man, we really with the shits, boy
Yeah, really with the shits
I should prolly sign to Hit-Boy 'cause I got all the hits, boy
Fuck all that ""Drake, you gotta chill"" shit
I be on my Lil Mouse drill shit
Fuck all that rap-to-pay-your-bill shit
Yeah, I'm on some Raptors-pay-my-bills shit
All up on TV, I thought it'd make me richer
Wasn't payin' me enough, I needed somethin' quicker
So now I'm all in Niko's basement puttin' work in on the phones
Either that or drive to Money Mart to make the pickups
Man, it's 2008, I'm tryna paint the picture
Comeback Season in the works and now I'm thinkin' bigger
I got 40 in the studio, every night, late night
Gotta watch that shit, don't want to make him sicker
That's my nigga
Oh Lord, got a whole lot to show for it
I mean we can really get it, we can go for it
I'm just here for the bucks and the billis, nigga
Don't make me kill one of the GOATs for it
I run this shit, they like, ""Go Forrest
Run Forrest, run Forrest, go Forrest""
Yeah, I mean you already wrote for us
Damn, nigga, what's one more quote for us?
Oh Lord, who else soundin' like this?
They ain't make me what I am, they just found me like this
I was ready... fuck that, I've been ready
Since my dad used to tell me
He was comin' to the house to get me
He ain't show up
Valuable lesson, man, I had to grow up
That's why I never ask for help
I'll do it for you niggas and do it for myself

[Outro]
I go 0 to 100, nigga, real quick
Real quick, whole squad on that real shit
0 to 100, nigga, real quick
Real quick, real fuckin' quick, nigga
0 to 100, nigga, real quick
Real quick, whole squad on that real shit
0 to 100, nigga, real quick
Real quick, real fuckin' quick, nigga

[Part II: The Catch Up]

[Bridge]
Whole squad on that real shit
Whole squad on that real shit
Whole squad on that real shit, yeah

[Verse 2]
The other night
Lavish Lee told me that I'm all these people listen to
She said they love me unconditional
Imagine how it feel to watch another nigga at the top
You know that if you wasn't you, you would be dissin' you, dawg
Damn, okay, from that perspective
I see what you're talkin' 'bout, no way to soften that
'Cause me, I was tryna find out where I lost 'em at
But maybe I ain't lose 'em at all
Maybe I keep movin' forward and they're just stagnant
They ain't movin' at all
But when they need a favor, who do they call?
Maybe I'm searchin' for the problems
Askin' what was said and who was involved
Too focused on people's feedback and provin' 'em wrong
They say the shoe can always fit, no matter whose foot it's on
These days feel like I'm squeezin' in 'em
Whoever wore 'em before just wasn't thinkin' big enough
I'm 'bout to leave 'em with 'em
'Cause if I run in the game in these, man, the seams are splittin'
No pun intended but they're smellin' defeat in the air
Headed where nobody took it, who meetin' me there?
They tell him that he's talkin' crazy but he doesn't care
Bein' humble don't work as well as bein' aware
Listen up, boy, you're better off eavesdroppin'
We already got spring 2015 poppin'
PND droppin', Reps-up P droppin'
Majid Jordan droppin', OB droppin', not to mention me droppin'
Feel like we paid the refs off, man, we fixed the game
Me and Noel been at it before Twitter names
Yeah, been on the move like the lease is up
And I can't even name one person that's keepin' up
Damn, fuck how it was in the past tense
Ask yourself, how do we match up now?
'Cause I'm only 27 and I'm only gettin' better
If I haven't passed you yet, watch me catch up now, for real

[Outro: James Blake]
Could it be the way that I'll catch up
Could it be the way that I'll catch up
Could it be the way that I'll catch up
Could it be the way that I'll catch up
Could it be the way that I'll catch up
Could it be the way that I'll catch up
Could it be the way that I'll catch up
Could it be the way that I'll catch up

It's fuckin' TR3YWAY!
King of New York, lookin' for the Queen
Uh, you got the right one, hmm
L-let these-l-let these b-b-bitches know, nigga
Queens, Brooklyn, brrr, ah!
Murda on the beat so it's not nice!

[Verse 1: 6ix9ine]
Pussy got that wet, wet, got that drip, drip
Got that super soaker, hit that
She a Fefe, her name Keke
She eat my dick like it's free, free
I don't even know like ""Why I did that?""
I don't even know like ""Why I hit that?""
All I know is that I just can't wife that
Talk to her nice so she won't fight back
Turn around and hit it from the back, back, back
Bend her down then I make it clap, clap, clap

[Chorus: 6ix9ine]
I don't really want no friends
I don't really want no friends, no

[Verse 2: 6ix9ine]
Draco got that kick-back when I blow that, they all do track
They don't shoot back, one shot, close range, red dot
Head tight, yeah, I did that, yeah, I live that
Call a Uber with my shooter, with a Ruger, we gon' do ya
Niggas say they killin' people, but I really fuckin' do it

[Chorus: 6ix9ine]
I don't really want no friends
I don't really want no friends, no

[Verse 3: Nicki Minaj]
He-he tryna 69 like Tekashi, call him papi
Word to A$AP, keep me Rocky, I'm from New York, so I'm cocky
Say he fuckin' with my posse, copped me Khloé like Kardashi'
Keep this pussy in Versace, said I'm pretty like Tinashe
Put-put it all up in his face, did I catch a case?
Pussy game just caught a body, but I never leave a trace
Face is pretty, ass for days, I get chips, I ask for Lay's
I just sit back and when he done, I be like, ""Yo, how'd it taste?""
(Yo, how'd it taste?)

[Chorus: 6ix9ine]
I don't really want no friends
I don't really want no friends, no

[Verse 4: Nicki Minaj]
Ayo, Draco got that kick-back
When it kick-back, you can't get yo shit back
In fact this that bitch that
""I hate small talk, I don't fuck with chit-chat""
AC just stopped workin'
So they hit me, told me bring my wrist back
Come through rockin' fashions
That got all these bitches like ""Yo, what's that?""
(Like ""Yo, what's that?"")

[Chorus: 6ix9ine & Nicki Minaj]
I don't really want no friends
I don't really want no friends, no

[Bridge: 6ix9ine & Nicki Minaj]
Eeny, meeny, miny, moe
I catch a ho right by her toe
If she ain't fuckin' me and Nicki
Kick that ho right through the door (TR3YWAY)
I don't really want no friends, my old ho just bought this Benz
Nicki just hopped in this shit, now I won't see that bitch again
Eeny, meeny, miny, moe (no)
I catch a ho right by her toe (no)
If she ain't fuckin' me and Nicki
Kick that ho right through the door (no, TR3YWAY)

Drake,From Time,"[Intro: Jhené Aiko]
What's up? Been a minute since we kicked it, you've been caught up
With them bitches, I don't get it, you're a star love
You shouldn't have to deal with that
I'd never make you feel like that, 'cause...

[Chorus: Jhené Aiko]
I love me, I love me enough for the both of us
That's why you trust me, I know you been through more than most of us
So what are you? What are you, what are you so afraid of?
Darling you, you give but you cannot take love

[Verse 1: Drake]
Yeah, I needed to hear that shit, I hate when you're submissive
Passive aggressive when we're texting, I feel the distance
I look around the peers that surround me, these niggas tripping
I like when money makes a difference but don't make you different
Started realizing a couple places I could take it
I want to get back to when I was that kid in the basement
I want to take it deeper than money, pussy, vacation
And influence a generation that's lacking in patience
I've been dealing with my dad, speaking of lack of patience
Just me and my old man getting back to basics
We've been talking 'bout the future and time that we wasted
When he put that bottle down, girl that nigga's amazing
Well, fuck it, we had a couple Coronas
We might have rolled a white paper, just something to hold us
We even talked about you and our couple of moments
He said we should hash it out like a couple of grown ups
You a flower child, beautiful child, I'm in your zone
Looking like you came from the 70's on your own
My mother is 66 and her favorite line to hit me with is
Who the fuck wants to be 70 and alone?
You don't even know what you want from love anymore
I search for something I'm missing and disappear when I'm bored
But girl, what qualities was I looking for before?
Who you settling for? Who better for you than the boy, huh?

[Chorus: Jhené Aiko]
I love me, I love me enough for the both of us
That's why you trust me, I know you been through more than most of us
So what are you? What are you, what are you so afraid of?
Darling you, you give but you cannot take love

[Verse 2: Drake]
Uh, thinking 'bout Texas, back when Porscha used to work at Treasures
Or further back than that, before I had the Houston leverage
When I got Summer a Michael Kors with my momma's debit
A weak attempt at flexing, I'll never forget it
'Cause that night I played her three songs
Then we got to talking 'bout something we disagreed on
Then she start telling me how I'll never be as big as Trey Songz
Boy was she wrong, that was just negative energy for me to feed off
Now it's therapeutic blowing money in the Galleria
Or Beverly Center Macy's where I discovered Bria
Landmarks of the muses that inspired the music
When I could tell it was sincere without tryna prove it
The one that I needed was Courtney from Hooters on Peachtree
I've always been feeling like she was the piece to complete me
Now she engaged to be married, what's the rush on commitment?
Know we were going through some shit, name a couple that isn't
Remember our talk in the parking lot at the Ritz
Girl I felt like we had it all planned out, I guess I fucked up the vision
Learning the true consequences of my selfish decisions
When you find out how I'm living, I just hope I'm forgiven
It seem like you don't want this love anymore
I'm acting out in the open, it's hard for you to ignore
But girl, what qualities was I looking for before?
Who you settling for? Who better for you than the boy, huh?

[Chorus: Jhené Aiko]
I love me, I love me enough for the both of us
That's why you trust me, I know you been through more than most of us
So what are you? What are you, what are you so afraid of?
Darling you, you give but you cannot take love

[Outro: Baka]
""Been Baka aka Not Nice from time, G
Been a East Side ting
Scarborough ting from time, G
Been have up di ting dem from time, G

Macklemore & Ryan Lewis,Same Love,"[Piano Intro]

[Verse 1: Macklemore]
When I was in the third grade, I thought that I was gay
‘Cause I could draw, my uncle was, and I kept my room straight
I told my mom, tears rushing down my face
She's like, ""Ben, you've loved girls since before Pre-K!""
Trippin', yeah I guess she had a point, didn't she?
A bunch of stereotypes all in my head
I remember doing the math like, ""Yeah, I'm good at little league.""
A pre-conceived idea of what it all meant
For those that like the same sex had the characteristics
The right-wing conservatives think it's a decision
And you can be cured with some treatment and religion
Man-made, rewiring of a pre-disposition
Playing God, aw nah, here we go
America the brave still fears what we don't know
And ""God loves all his children"" is somehow forgotten
But we paraphrase a book written thirty-five hundred years ago
I don't know

[Hook: Mary Lambert]
And I can't change, even if I tried
Even if I wanted to
And I can't change, even if I tried
Even if I wanted to
My love, my love, my love
She keeps me warm
She keeps me warm
She keeps me warm
She keeps me warm

[Verse 2: Macklemore]
If I was gay, I would think hip-hop hates me
Have you read the YouTube comments lately?
""Man, that's gay"" gets dropped on the daily
We've become so numb to what we're sayin'
Our culture founded from oppression
Yet we don't have acceptance for 'em
Call each other faggots behind the keys of a message board
A word rooted in hate, yet our genre still ignores it
""Gay"" is synonymous with the lesser
It's the same hate that's caused wars from religion
Gender to skin color, the complexion of your pigment
The same fight that led people to walk-outs and sit-ins
It's human rights for everybody, there is no difference
Live on and be yourself
When I was at church they taught me something else
If you preach hate at the service, those words aren't anointed
That holy water that you soak in has been poisoned
When everyone else is more comfortable remaining voiceless
Rather than fighting for humans that have had their rights stolen
I might not be the same, but that's not important
No freedom 'til we're equal, damn right I support it

[Trombone Interlude]

[Hook: Mary Lambert]
And I can't change, even if I tried
Even if I wanted to
My love, my love, my love
She keeps me warm
She keeps me warm
She keeps me warm
She keeps me warm

[Verse 3: Macklemore]
We press play, don't press pause: progress, march on!
With a veil over our eyes, we turn our back on the cause
'Til the day that my uncles can be united by law
Kids are walking 'round the hallway
Plagued by a pain in their heart
A world so hateful, some would rather die than be who they are
And a certificate on paper isn't gonna solve it all
But it's a damn good place to start
No law's gonna change us, we have to change us
Whatever god you believe in, we come from the same one
Strip away the fear, underneath it's all the same love
About time that we raised up!

[Hook: Mary Lambert]
And I can't change, even if I tried
Even if I wanted to
And I can't change, even if I tried
Even if I wanted to
My love, my love, my love
She keeps me warm
She keeps me warm
She keeps me warm
She keeps me warm
